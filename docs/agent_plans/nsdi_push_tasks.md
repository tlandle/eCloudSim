# NSDI push: task list (hand to a working session)

Context anchors, read first:
- `docs/kb/wiki/current_state.md` top three entries (provenance alert, design-sweep campaign, defense outcome).
- `docs/agent_plans/khonsu_design_studies.md` (sweep matrix, arm semantics).
- Memory: `project_khonsu_budget_contribution` (the reframed contribution),
  `project_flow_table_provenance` (DO NOT cite q4_flow_table.csv numbers).

Hard constraints:
- Sims run under conda env `opencda310` (`source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate opencda310`), CARLA 0.9.15 local. The sweep script manages CARLA itself; never manage CARLA by hand while it runs.
- `pkill -f` self-matches your own command line; use bracketed patterns like `pkill -f 'khonsu_design_swee[p]'`.
- Runs are self-describing: every flow run ends with a `[RUNROW]` line; extract with `python scripts/khonsu_design_extract.py <logdir> -o rows.csv`. A log without an ego `actor_id` dict is a crashed run, RUNROW or not.
- Between-arm comparisons from the uniform sweep are valid; absolute collision rates are NOT paper-grade until the scenario grind (every arm 10/10 collided, buffer-capped 30 contact ticks, stalls at the truck) is diagnosed. Do not present absolute safety rates from flow runs.
- Writing rules: memory `feedback_writing_simply` (define terms at first use, no personification, no flourishes), `feedback_no_invented_terms`, `feedback_eval_ground_up_no_letter_arms` (named arms, never B0/B1), no em dashes.

## T1. Lookahead-matched warm arms (no new code, run first)
Run `MIGRATION_MODE=warm LOOKAHEAD_S={2,3,4}` x 10 reps on
`openscenario_1_flow_gt` by extending `scripts/khonsu_design_sweep.sh`
(add s1_warm_la{2,3,4} entries mirroring the existing pattern) and
relaunching with the same `LOGDIR=evaluation_outputs/khonsu_design_sweep_v1`
(resumable; done runs skip). Acceptance: 30 new rows in the extract with
transfers > 0; a lead-matched trigger table (forecast at 2/3/4 s vs bands
20/40 m vs at-crossing) added to
`docs/kb/data/relay_eval_2026_08/` with a KB note.

## T2. Scenario grind diagnosis (blocks all absolute numbers)
Symptom: every arm sustains one 30+-tick contact episode at the stopped
truck; median run times out at 50 s around x~67 m. Known-good behavior
existed on 2026-08-16 (KB "STALL ROOT FIXED" entry) but no longer
reproduces from any commit (bisection log: KB raw/sessions/2026-08-31.md).
Approach: single warm run with `BEHAVIOR_DEBUG=1`, trace whether the
stopped-lead car-following branch (behavior_agent.py, `_find_blocking_lead`)
engages on approach; if it does, trace the overtake commit gate. Compare
tick traces against the documented 08-16 fix semantics. Acceptance: named
root cause + minimal fix + 5 warm reps with 0-episode majority, THEN rerun
the full sweep (script is ready) for paper-grade absolute rates.

## T3. Computed trigger (the paper's mechanism claim)
Implement `TRIGGER_MODE=computed` in
`ecav/scenario_testing/openscenario_1_flow_gt.py`: fire when remaining
time-to-crossing <= predicted destination warm-up (backhaul transfer time
+ import + destination refresh-queue delay estimate) + margin. The
destination's refresh cadence is observable from the edge manager
(adaptive controller, deadline 130 ms). Baselines already exist (fixed
leads, bands). Acceptance: computed-trigger arm x 10 reps; lead-time
distribution logged per fire; comparison table vs fixed leads.

## T4. Platoon-burst scenario (feasible-region claim)
Variant of the flow scenario where N in {2,4,8} NPCs cross the boundary
within one 2 s window (edit `scenario_1_flow.xml` spawn spacing or add
`scenario_1_burst.xml`). Measure per-track transfer-to-first-refresh
latency at the destination (RUNROW extension or frames CSV) vs N, with
and without the existing risk-ordered admission. Acceptance: a
first-refresh-latency-vs-burst-size table; the crossing-load feasibility
boundary stated with numbers.

## T5. Paper updates — OWNED BY THE WRITING SESSION, skip (~/repos/scale_out_nsdi)
Port from the dissertation (~/repos/dissertation
contents/paper5-scaleout.tex, already written): the delivery/authority
overlap decomposition (6.1.1), the trigger-as-measured-axis subsection,
and the ownership-handshake reframe (one send + two-step authority;
"two-phase" only as EdgeWarp lineage). Update evaluation.tex arms to the
uniform-sweep names. Cite canvas_latency.csv for the locale-size cap.
Do NOT import q4 numbers; T1/T2 outputs replace them. Compile must stay
at the venue page budget; check before committing.

## T6. Figures — OWNED BY THE WRITING SESSION once T1/T2 data lands, skip
Regenerate the headline figures from the new rows.csv once T1/T2 land:
lead-time curve (exists: see scratchpad story deck pattern), trigger
comparison, burst feasibility. Style: matplotlib, NAVY/GOLD palette used
in the story deck, captions state the finding
(memory: figures must have findings).

## Review-driven additions (2026-09-03). Priority: T7, T8, T9 before T3/T4; T10, T11 after.
Source: external NSDI review. Deadlines: abstract Sep 10, full paper Sep 17.
The writing session is reframing the paper around these; do not edit ~/repos/scale_out_nsdi.

## T7. Ownership epochs + fencing + failure injection (protocol correctness)
The paper claims exactly one publisher per track, and its failure model admits
"briefly both claim a track". Make the invariant true. In
`ecav/core/application/edge/migration/payload.py` add `epoch: int` to
`MigrationPayload` (monotonic per track, source increments at PREPARE, commit
carries the epoch). Every published forecast carries `(actor_id, epoch)`;
consumers (the ego eval path in `openscenario_1_flow_gt.py`) accept only the
highest epoch seen and drop lower. Add `FAULT_MODE` knob: `lost_prepare`,
`lost_ack`, `lost_commit`, `dup_commit`, `reorder`, `dst_crash`, each injected
once per run at the transfer. Acceptance: 6 fault arms x 5 reps; a table of
(fault, transfers, stale-epoch drops, double-publish windows in ticks,
completion). Double-publish windows must be 0 with fencing on; report the
number without fencing as the baseline.

## T8. Real two-process transfer over gRPC + netem (replace the parametric link)
Today `MigrationPayload.serialize()` is pickle and transfer time is computed,
not sent. Build a minimal `migration.proto` (bytes payload + actor_id + epoch +
schema_version), a `MigrationRelay` gRPC servicer running in a second process
on Atlas, and have the flow scenario's PREPARE/COMMIT path send real bytes.
Backhaul delay/loss via `tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 5ms 20ms loss 1%`
(needs sudo; document the exact commands). Acceptance: p50/p95/p99 for
PREPARE, delta-at-commit, import, and COMMIT under netem {0, 5, 20, 50} ms
and loss {0, 1, 5}%; bytes on the wire per transfer; a `[RUNROW]` extension
with these fields. Keep `TRANSFER_MODE=parametric` as the fallback.

## T9. Post-handoff prediction metrics (minADE/minFDE), not only tracker displacement
From existing microbench and flow runs, compute post-handoff minADE@3s,
minFDE@5s, and miss rate (2 m) for the migrated tracks at the destination,
per arm (cold, kf, warm, warm+delta), for the first 5 refreshes after commit.
Prediction outputs are in the frames CSV / eval logs (see
`scripts/khonsu_design_extract.py` for paths). Acceptance: one table, arms x
metrics, with 95% CIs over seeds; CSV under `docs/kb/data/relay_eval_2026_08/`.

## T10. Cross-locale association for unconnected actors (staged; may not finish)
Today `stable_actor_id` is ground-truth injected. Implement an overlap-region
track-continuation step at import: match the migrated track (source token +
last bbox transformed into destination frame) against destination detections
in the sensing overlap using temporal gating (predicted position at import
time) + Mahalanobis distance on the KF covariance / bbox size; ambiguity
(two candidates inside the gate) forces the explicit cold fallback. Knob
`ASSOC_MODE={gt, gated}`; add pose-error injection `ASSOC_POSE_ERR_M` and a
distractor NPC spawned alongside the crossing actor. Acceptance: ID-switch
rate and false-association rate vs pose error {0, 0.5, 1, 2} m and distractor
{off, on}, connected ego vs unconnected actor separately, 10 reps each.

## T11. Trigger study on real trajectories (V2X-Seq), staged
Offline: take V2X-Seq trajectory sequences (dataset path: ask Tyler; not on
Atlas yet), draw synthetic locale boundaries every 250-300 m along the
corridor, run the constant-velocity and MTR forecast triggers with lead
{1, 2, 3, 4} s and bands {20, 40} m, and compute per trigger: crossing recall,
wrong-destination rate, false-prefetch rate, late-prefetch rate, lead-time
CDF, wasted bytes, and probability-threshold sensitivity. Acceptance: one
table + lead-time CDF figure data CSV. This replaces the CARLA-only trigger
comparison as the paper's trigger evidence if it finishes.

## Reframe additions (2026-09-04). The paper now asks: how does cooperative prediction scale from one locale (Conductor) to a metropolitan deployment? Four RQs: scale-out, state continuity, safe handoff, multi-locale operation.

## T12. Re-measure the safe-age envelope inside the Khonsu scenarios (RQ3 needs it; the envelope paper is unpublished)
For each closed-loop handoff scenario (blind overtake, acceleration, LTAP, SCP, stopped lead), inject a controlled forecast age at the planner (delay the consumed forecast by d ms, d in {100..600} step 50) with NO migration effects, and find the largest d at which the maneuver still completes without collision across seeds. That d is the scenario's safe-age limit tau(u). Acceptance: a table scenario x tau(u) with CIs, 5 seeds per point; the paper cites these instead of the 220-450 ms figure. Reuse the envelope harness knobs if they still exist (AOI_INJECT / forecast delay); otherwise add a consume-side delay knob in the ego eval path.

## T13. Multi-locale corridor (RQ4, the capstone; biggest new build)
Scenario: 3 to 5 consecutive locales along an arterial (A | B | C | D), each with its own canvas, RSU at its conflict anchor, and a service instance; adjacent sensing overlap sufficient for handoff. One ego drives the whole corridor. Actors cross boundaries independently, some accelerating or braking; conflicts at intersection centers AND traffic-generated between intersections (queue tail, stopped vehicle, overtake, merge); several tracks cross one boundary together; some migrations land on a destination already busy. Arms over the WHOLE route: cold, reactive/boundary, EdgeWarp timing, geometric overlap, continuous replication, Khonsu, oracle.
Metrics per route: continuity (fraction of handoffs warm before use, post-handoff ADE/FDE, track resets/ID switches, fallbacks per km); planner safety (age at use vs tau(u), min TTC, collisions, hard/false braking, route completion); system (migrations/s, concurrent migrations, bytes/s between locales, import and first-refresh latency, per-locale compute utilization, prepared-but-unpublished tracks, failure point vs crossing rate); repeated handoffs (metrics by crossing index 1st/2nd/3rd, stale epochs, ping-pong).
Build path: generalize the two-locale flow runner to N locales (registry already maps areas to locales), extend the RUNROW to per-handoff rows with crossing index and locale ids, and a corridor XML. Start with 3 locales and the existing ego route stitched; 5 reps per arm. Acceptance: one route-level table (arms x metrics) and one figure (metric vs crossing index). Priority: after v3 lands and T7-live; ahead of T10/T11 if time is short. Flag to Tyler if it cannot land by Sep 15.

## T13 concrete spec (writing session proposal, adapt as needed)
Map: the arterial used by the flow scenario. Four locales of ~300 m centered on consecutive intersections; boundaries at the midpoints between anchors (~150 m from each). Ego route ~1.2 km at the 12 m/s contract speed, three handoffs. Oncoming stream FLOW_N in {4, 8} (~2-4 crossings/min per boundary), connected share 50%. Conflicts: crossing path at anchors 1 and 3; queue tail on segment 1; stopped vehicle + overtake on segment 2; merge on segment 3; the 5-vehicle platoon crossing boundary 2 together. Success per run: ego completes without collision; age at use <= tau(u) at every planner decision; >= 95% of handoffs warm before first use; no stale-epoch forecast consumed. 5 seeds per arm. Descoping order as you proposed.

## T14. Overlap in three meanings, over overlap width (the professors' question)
Arms: sensing overlap only (both locales observe the band, state still migrates on the forecast trigger); compute overlap (destination starts processing the actor at overlap entry, geometric prefetch); dual authority (both locales publish; planner rule = highest epoch, record disagreements). Sweep overlap width {20, 40, 80, 120} m. Metrics: fraction of handoffs warm before first use, bytes per crossing, fraction of planner ticks with two disagreeing forecasts for one actor (dueling rate, disagreement threshold 0.5 m at 1 s), age at use, collisions. 5 seeds per cell on the two-locale scenario. Priority: after T12, before T10/T11.

## Rerun rule (Tyler, 2026-09-04): if an issue is found at any point during an experiment (harness, scenario, logging, environment), fix it and rerun the whole experiment on the fixed code so that every figure is drawn from one clean run set. Do not assemble a figure from partial or mixed-version rows, do not caveat a figure around a known defect, and do not carry a defective arm forward with a footnote. The v1/v2 provenance failure and the s5 pinned-worktree failures are the precedent: the fix each time was a rerun, not a caveat.

## T23. Factorial continuity arms (reviewer, 2026-09-06 evening): de-confound WHAT moves from WHEN it moves
Experiment A (timing fixed = Khonsu trigger + final update; state varied): cold (none), one_frame (latest detection), kf (Kalman state), hist2, hist5 (2- and 5-frame observation history), warm (full record). Experiment B (state fixed = full record; timing varied): reactive (at boundary), edgewarp_full (EdgeWarp predicted-attachment pre-copy + final sync carrying the full record), band20, band40, fixed leads 1-4 s, computed, mtr, oracle. Per handoff for timing arms: warm_before_first_use, wrong_destination, wasted bytes. Ten seeds tonight on freeze-1i, added to the Atlas chain after A/B seeds 1-10. Paper §5.2 = Experiment A, §5.5 = Experiment B.

## T24. Traffic-generated conflicts near boundaries (reviewer): measure how often queue tails, stopped vehicles, overtakes, and lane changes occur within the boundary band in the corridor traffic (and Multi-V2X traces if a boundary layout is drawn on them); one number per conflict type per km of boundary. Supports §2.3; CPU analysis after T13.

## Metric rule (Tyler): report collided-or-not per run (fraction of runs with any ego contact) and completed-without-collision. Do not report mean collision episodes per run.

## T15. Predictor-mode trigger (must-fix for the headline claim; reviewer 2026-09-04)
The evaluated trigger today is a constant-velocity projection of the tracked velocity (openscenario_1_flow_gt.py TRIGGER_MODE=predictive). The paper's design says the trigger consumes the cooperative predictor's trajectories. Implement TRIGGER_MODE=mtr: for each MTR mode of the track, find the first locale boundary crossed within the horizon; sum mode probabilities by destination locale; prepare the destination with the highest probability once it exceeds theta (default 0.5; sweep 0.3-0.9 in the trigger study). Keep the CV projection as TRIGGER_MODE=cv (an ablation arm). Log per fire: destination, probability, lead. Acceptance: v3-style rerun of the warm/computed arms with the MTR trigger (10 reps), plus the trigger-study table with both triggers. Priority: after T12, before T14.

## Priority change: T10 (association for unconnected actors) moves ahead of T11. The reviewer's view is that simulator-supplied identity is too exposed for the submission now that cross-locale continuity is the central claim. A geometry + motion + IoU association in the overlap is sufficient; it does not need to be an ML contribution.

## Section 4-5 review additions (2026-09-04, late)

## T16. Faithful EdgeWarp arm (baseline fidelity)
The current `edgewarp` arm is a snapshot at the handover event with no pre-copy, which is not EdgeWarp. Implement: predict the next radio attachment (use the cell-attachment predictor already in the ns-3 plane or a distance-to-cell-edge rule), pre-copy the same track record to the corresponding edge on that prediction, and send a final synchronization at the radio handover event. Keep the current arm as `handover_snapshot`. Acceptance: both arms in the flow and corridor tables.

## T17. Import-age ablation
At import the destination extrapolates the last box by the transferred ground velocity for the elapsed time (constant velocity). Measure first-destination-forecast error vs elapsed import age {0, 50, 100, 200, 400} ms, on the acceleration and straight scenarios, 10 reps. Acceptance: one small table or figure for §5.2.

## T18. Lead-constant sensitivity
Sweep M in {0.15, 0.35, 0.6} s and the lead cap in {1.5, 2.5, 4.0} s on the flow scenario with the forecast trigger; report completion and warm-before-first-use. Acceptance: one table for §5.5.

## Two facts to confirm for the paper: (a) K = max_window = 10 in mamba3dmot/wrapper.py (used in the byte table); (b) what TRIGGER_DIST=300 controls in the flow scenario (the paper currently labels it "oncoming stream release distance"; correct it if wrong).

## Figure completeness additions (2026-09-04, Tyler: every figure in the deck and paper must be producible from a run)

Audit of the seven expected-shape figures (slides/toy_figs.py) and the paper's figure placeholders against the tasks above: faults (T7), corridor (T13), and the trigger front (T15/s5/T18) have a producing eval; envelope, overlap, crossing load, and sizing do not fully; two shared quantities are not logged. The following close every gap. Each is required, not optional.

## T19. Per-handoff timing rows (prerequisite for T15, T14, T13, T19b; do first)
Extend the run log with one `[HANDOFFROW]` per migrated track: run tag, track id, crossing index, locale from/to, prepare send time, commit time, first destination publish time, first planner use time (first tick the ego's planner consumed a forecast for that track from the destination), warm_before_first_use (publish < first use), bytes sent, prepared_but_never_crossed (wasted), epoch. This is the primary metric of §5.5, §5.6, and §5.7 and the y-axis of the trigger and overlap figures; the current RUNROW (tx, by) cannot produce it. Acceptance: rows present in every arm from T15 onward; a one-run smoke showing warm_before_first_use for each crossing.

## T19b. Crossing-load sweep (the load figure: p99 transfer-to-first-refresh vs concurrent tracks)
Platoon size {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} crossing one boundary together (generalize the burst scenario's 5-vehicle platoon; spacing 15 m). Arms: Khonsu (forecast trigger), continuous replication, dual-service overlap (destination processes the platoon from overlap entry), handover snapshot, cold. Per track: transfer-to-first-refresh latency (prepare send to first destination forecast) p50/p95/p99, warm_before_first_use, collided-or-not per run. 5 reps per cell. Mark the p95 concurrent-crossing count observed in T13 on the axis. Acceptance: one CSV; the concurrent-track count at which Khonsu's p99 exceeds the handoff budget.

## T20. Trigger oracle arm
Prepare at exactly crossing_time - L using the simulator's ground-truth future trajectory (the actor's actual crossing time is known offline). Add TRIGGER_MODE=oracle. Runs in the T15 trigger study (two-locale) and as the "oracle" arm of T13. Acceptance: oracle point on the trigger front (warm-before-use, wasted bytes = 0 by construction) and the oracle row in the corridor table.

## T21. Edge compute per vehicle-second
Log per locale per tick the wall time of fusion + tracking + prediction and the number of vehicles served; derive edge compute per vehicle-second per arm. Needed for the overlap cost panel (T14), the alternatives figure (§5.6), and sizing (T22). Acceptance: the field in every RUNROW from T14 onward; a one-run smoke with the value for each locale.

## T14 amendment
Add the 20 m/s speed (ONCOMING_SPEED=20) for widths {20, 40, 80, 120} m, 5 seeds, all three forms. The overlap figure plots warm-before-use against width per speed; one speed cannot show that the lead from a fixed width shrinks with speed. Report edge compute per vehicle-second (T21) per form and width.

## T12 amendment 2 (Tyler, 2026-09-05 night): age through ns-3, not injected delay
The age at use must be produced by the ns-3 radio plane. Sweep the radio-plane load (the LatencyModel knob that moves the sampled C-V2X latency distribution) over enough levels that realized age at use spans ~50-800 ms; log realized age of the consumed forecast per planner decision (AOIROW + load level); derive tau(u) from realized age in 50 ms bins with the same rule; report the load-level to age mapping (p50/p95 per level). The injected-delay (AOI_INJECT_MS) runs are pilot data only and do not enter the paper.

## T12 amendment (one success rule everywhere)
Report, per scenario and delay d, the fraction of seeds that complete without a collision (the full curve; the envelope figure draws it). tau(u) = the largest d at which every seed completes without a collision. The paper states this rule; the 0.95 wording is replaced. If a scenario needs finer resolution, 10 seeds at the two delays bracketing tau(u).

## T22. Locale sizing analysis (after T8 and T13; analysis, not a run)
For locale side L in 100..600 m step 25: compute utilization from the canvas sweep (exists, canvas_latency.csv); handoff-load utilization = crossing rate(L) x per-handoff cost / handoff budget, with crossing rate from the T13 traffic (crossings per boundary per minute at FLOW_N 4 and 8, scaled by 1/L) and per-handoff cost from T8 (prepare + commit + import + first refresh, p95). Output docs/kb/data/relay_eval_2026_08/q7_sizing_v2.csv with both curves; the feasible interval is where both are under 100%.

Order: T1 (tonight, safe) and T2 (the gate) first; T3/T4 build while T2's rerun goes. T5/T6 belong to the parallel writing session; do not touch ~/repos/scale_out_nsdi. Commit style: one subject
line, no co-author trailers (user rule). Update
docs/kb/wiki/current_state.md after each block.
