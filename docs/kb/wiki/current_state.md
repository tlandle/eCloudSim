## 2026-09-10 (code session): figure-vs-block arm audit; every block checked; capacity rescoped; EdgeWarp appendix conflict; new landers

Peer-driven cross-check: for each block my chain feeds, compare the arm list the FIGURE iterates against what the RUNNER drives. Figures identify arms by arm_of(r) (mode/trigger/band columns) OR by a tag-prefix arm column (TRIGGER_ORDER) OR by ld_ tag split. Three mismatches found and fixed, plus a paper-claim conflict.

- CORRIDOR: was 6 arms, the alternatives figure + tab_corridor iterate ALT_ORDER = 13 (cold, handover_snapshot, kf, kf_final, edgewarp, reactive, band20, band40, band80, replication, repl_final, warm, oracle). Fixed cetus_corridor_run.sh to all 13 (edgewarp=MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp_full; band20/40/80=warm+TRIGGER_MODE=band+BAND_W_M; oracle=warm+TRIGGER_MODE=oracle). Verified corridor_gt supports band/oracle triggers + all modes; generated corridor carries exactly these 13. khonsu_ef0 kept (unfenced control, NOT in ALT_ORDER). 13x5 + ef0x5 = 70 routes.
- CAPACITY: the burst+q5 block feeds the APPENDIX (tab:scale + \nDens{arm}{Two,Four,Eight} at FLOW_N 2/4/8, arms warm/edgewarp/cold; burst 5/5 platoon), NOT fig_capacity. Confirmed q5 IS consumed (appendix.tex:349) before nearly dropping it. Capped SEEDS 10->5 (paper says "of 5"; 60 runs). fig_capacity is a SEPARATE ld_<mode>_p<platoon> block (see GAP D).
- EDGEWARP APPENDIX CONFLICT (real result, not a bug): measured freeze-1n burst = warm 5/5, edgewarp_full 5/5, cold 0/5. Appendix claimed EdgeWarp 0/5 (a hardcoded literal, no provenance). Peer chose option (a): measurement stands, rewrite the sentence (five-vehicle platoon separates state-transfer from none, not full-record from EdgeWarp timing; separation, if any, shows in the 2/4/8 density macros). Rejected fitting the arm/scenario to the prose.

NEW LANDERS in khonsu_1l_land.py (all committed):
- rows: generic flow rows -> frozen1n_rows.csv (overlap), skips th_mtr* and fb_band5 (band5 is handoff-only). run_band refactored to share _flow_overlap_row. std_row parses _v{spd} for per-row oncoming speed (two-speed band).
- handoffs: per-[HANDOFFROW] -> frozen1n_handoffs.csv (trigger_pareto + lead_cdf). arm=tag stem (tr_computed/mtr/oracle/look2/4, fb_band5/20/40/80). crossed/warm/lead/track work; crossed=NO wasted-prepare rows ARE logged. bytes BLANK (flow logs have no XFERROW; needs a behavior-inert bytes= field on HANDOFFROW from payload_bytes(), pending peer decision (a), before flow-arms runs). drift_m blank on purpose.
- density: burst+q5 -> frozen1n_density_rows.csv + frozen1n_density_macros.tex (\nBurst{Khonsu,Edgewarp,Cold} + \nDens{arm}{Two,Four,Eight}, "N of M"). Provenance header (MEASURED, tag, logdir, date). Validated: burst final = Khonsu 5/5, Edgewarp 5/5, Cold 0/5.
- t12lut: per-run sweep + per-decision t12_lut_decisions.csv (built earlier this session).

FLOW-ARMS runner: band widths {5,10,20,40,80,120}; {10,20,40,80,120} at speeds {12,20} (overlap), band5 at 12 only (handoff). trigger {computed,mtr@0.5,oracle}, mtr-theta {0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}, lookahead {2,3,4}, baseline.

GAP D (fig_capacity ld_ block) DEFERRED, triple-blocked: (1) no variable-platoon scenario (burst_gt is fixed layout, no knob); peer wants an INERT-when-unset PLATOON_N knob on burst_gt (prove inertness with a paired no-knob run vs the landed row) rather than a new scenario; (2) probe needs a free GPU (both busy 15-40h); (3) 200-sample floor per point unsized. Plan: add inert knob, probe platoon 1 and 16 on atlas after regions frees, count samples, size WITH the peer (do not guess; do not start the sweep before the two counts exist). Last block, nothing queues behind it.

OUT-OF-CHAIN (faults/transport/association): each has a matching lander (faults FAULTS_COLS is a superset of the figure schema; transport netem + assoc landers exist). No freeze-1n rerun now (provenance question deferred until measured blocks land; do not spend the compute).

CHAIN-WAIT bug fixed earlier: 14h->48h (t12 would have aborted before flow-arms finished). Chain: capacity(capped 5, q5 running) -> flowarms -> t12 -> corridor, whole-block-per-host, poll armed for the flow-arms first row.

## 2026-09-10 (code session): host-effect validated; 3 of 5 "missing runners" are flow-block arms, not new sweeps

HOST-EFFECT TEST (freeze-1n, cold_v20_s1, fixed seed, 3 reps/host). atlas episodes 0/0/0 all completed, phantoms 35/39/35; cetus episodes 0/0/0 all completed, phantoms 47/26/45. Collision outcome identical across both hosts and all six reps: no host effect on outcome, no run-to-run non-determinism on outcome for this cell. Phantom count is a nuisance variable only (within-host spread atlas 4 / cetus 21; cross-host medians 36 vs 45) and does not convert to collisions. Whole-blocks-per-host validated: any residual host offset stays within-block and preserves arm-to-arm. Byte-identical models already verified (verify_models.sh + models.manifest). Regions can restart on freeze-1n on atlas.

MISSING-RUNNER AUDIT (peer traced figure->CSV consumers; I traced the flow runner env params). The flow runner runner_wired.py (overlays openscenario_1_flow_gt.py) reads: MIGRATION_MODE, LOOKAHEAD_S (1.0), TRIGGER_MODE (predictive), MTR_THETA (0.5), BAND_W_M (20.0), COMMIT_REFRESH (none), MIRROR_PERIOD_S (0.0), ONCOMING_SPEED, TRIGGER_DIST, NET_LAT_MS/JITTER/LOSS. TRIGGER_MODE branches on predictive/band/mtr/oracle/computed (runner_wired.py:551/562/605/628). Consequence: 3 of the 5 "missing runners" are cell enumerations inside the flow block, not new runners:
- Overlap = band-width arms. TRIGGER_MODE=band + BAND_W_M. scripts/khonsu_design_sweep.sh ALREADY enumerates band {5,10,20,40,80}; figure wants {10,20,40,80,120}. CAVEAT: only the geometric band trigger exists in code; the T14 three-forms taxonomy (sensing-only / compute-overlap / dual-authority) is NOT three distinct modes. If the overlap figure reads band-width arms from frozengen_rows.csv it is fine; three-forms would be a code gap (peer's call).
- Trigger-Pareto = TRIGGER_MODE {predictive,band,computed,mtr,oracle} + MTR_THETA {0.3..0.9}. Drivable now, no existing enumeration of the non-band modes.
- Lookahead (T18) = LOOKAHEAD_S {1,2,3,4}. Drivable now. T18 also sweeps M {0.15,0.35,0.6}s and lead cap {1.5,2.5,4.0}s; those two knobs NOT yet confirmed as env params.
GENUINELY NEED WORK:
- Controlled-age (T12): the one real separate sweep, frozengen_age_sweep_rows.csv (STD + scenario, inject_ms, baseline_age_ms, realized_age_ms; scenarios acceleration + blind overtake). Consume-side knob AOI_INJECT_MS EXISTS (behavior_agent_1m.py:342). Conflict: Tyler's T12 amendment 2 requires age via the ns-3 radio plane (NET_LAT_MS/load) and marks AOI_INJECT runs pilot-only, while figure_schemas.md:50 still names the AOI_INJECT_MS knob and axis realized_age_ms = pipeline age + injected delay. Needs a wrapper enumerating age levels + logging realized_age_ms and a lander emitting the age_sweep schema; knob choice pending peer/Tyler.
- Import-age (T17): NO registry CSV, NO IMPORT_AGE knob. Currently a projected sentence in the record appendix (evaluation.tex:265-267, error < 0.05 m for 0-400 ms). Only needs a knob + small measurement if it must be measured.
NET: zero new full runners. Plan sent to peer: extend khonsu_design_sweep.sh into a freeze-1n flow-arms enumeration (band/trigger/lookahead) with verify_models + hard-fail-on-missing-RUNROW + [CELLTIME] + frozengen-schema lander; build controlled-age once the knob is chosen; import-age only if measured. Tasks #29/#30/#31 reduce to enumeration + one small build.

RESOLUTION AND BUILDS (2026-09-10 evening, all decisions from the peer after reading the generated files directly, not the plan):
- FLOW-ARMS RUNNER built: scripts/cetus_flow_arms_run.sh (commit chain 846c5f8a...). Whole-block-per-host on cetus, chained after capacity (idle-waits for frozen_1n_capacity/_done + GPU idle). Per seed x5: baseline (warm/predictive/1s); band {10,20,40,80,120} at BOTH speeds 12 and 20 (10 cells; _v20 tag; std_row parses _v so the two-speed curves never collide; matches frozengen_rows.csv's 80 band rows exactly, peer verified); trigger {computed, mtr@0.5, oracle}; mtr-theta {0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}; lookahead {2,3,4}. Full working-runner guards. Tags match landers: fb_band{w}[_v20]_r{s} -> band lander; th_mtr{th}_s{s} -> theta lander; fa_* -> new generic "rows" lander.
- GENERIC ROWS LANDER added to khonsu_1l_land.py: run_rows (subcommand "rows") lands every flow log via RUNROW into frozen1n_rows.csv matching frozengen_rows.csv (all arms), skips th_mtr* so rows.csv keeps one mtr arm. run_band refactored to share _flow_overlap_row. BAND_TAG_RE widened for the _v20 variant.
- LOOKAHEAD extra axes (T18 M=0.35, lead cap=2.5) are HARDCODED literals (runner_wired.py:596-597/644-647), back no paper claim (peer grepped), DROPPED, on the post-deadline list beside the sideswipe. Import-age: one projected sentence in evaluation.tex:265-267, no measurement path, the peer commented it out (paper repo, peer's domain).
- CONTROLLED-AGE (T12) RESOLVED TO THE RADIO PLANE, not injection. Decisive trace: Ns3LutSampler is enabled by DEFAULT (use_ns3_lut=True) so the flow scenario already stamps UL+DL through the ns-3 C-V2X LUT; NS3_LUT_N is the load dial ("T12 load sweep override"), and the freeze-1l fix (overlay line 443) makes it index the LUT CELL while the max stays over the live uploader count (identical to live at N=scene, load rises smoothly through the cell). AGEROW logs realized_age_ms + network_age_ms per decision in the freeze-1n overlay. All in the frozen base/overlay, ZERO code change. A freeze-1f measurement already exists (t12_lut_rows.csv/t12_lut_decisions.csv, blindovertake only) but was defective (NS3_LUT_N tail-sampling bug, fixed in freeze-1l), so freeze-1n is a clean rerun. Injection (AOI_INJECT_MS) stays Tyler's pilot-only.
- T12 RUNNER + LANDER built: scripts/cetus_t12_lut_run.sh (chained after flow-arms) sweeps NS3_LUT_N {4,8,12,16,20,24,31} x 10 seeds x {blindovertake=openscenario_1_flow_gt, accel=openscenario_1_accel_gt}, warm-with-migration (matches freeze-1f/1j), tag t12_{scn}_n{N}_s{seed}, AGEROW hard-fail + accel-first probe (accel t12 unproven on freeze-1f). khonsu_1l_land.py t12lut emits TWO files: per-run sweep (STD_COLS + T12_SWEEP_EXTRA; realized_age_ms = maneuver-decision age via kad.launch_tick, fallback p50; the envelope figure reads scenario/realized_age_ms/collided/completed) and per-decision t12_lut_decisions.csv (scenario, ns3_lut_n, seed, realized_age_ms, network_age_ms, run_collided; figure bottom panel reads ns3_lut_n). Lander validated end-to-end on a renamed real log (1 sweep row, 1041 decision rows, correct columns). 10 seeds (not 5): age_bins drops any 100 ms bin with <8 RUNS and a lone load level contributes only its own seeds, so 5 silently drops unpaired levels. Bin stays 100 ms figure-side (lander emits raw per-run ages, no pre-binning); the amendment's 50 ms note is being updated to 100. Mid-course check pending: after blindovertake completes, count runs per 100 ms bin, densify near the cliff if any bin < 8.
- CETUS CHAIN (all whole-block-per-host, four live tmux): capacity (running) -> flowarms (waits frozen_1n_capacity/_done) -> t12 (waits frozen_1n_flow_arms/_done) -> corridor (waits frozen_1n_t12/_done). ATLAS: regions freeze-1n grid running in idfix_wt (frozen_1n_t25, first row t25_cold_v6_s1 valid) + landloop (frozen1n_t25_rows.csv every 10 min). Flow-arms first row to be confirmed when capacity frees (background poll armed).
- CORRIDOR RERUN QUEUED (peer correction: it WAS dropped from my chain; it must run on freeze-1n as the sole source of RQ3/RQ4 columns = ownership fencing, age-at-use continuity, bytes/crossing, crossing timeline; judged on those, NOT route_success, since every arm sideswipes the parked truck regardless of migration state; the pre-fix 3-route rows are abandoned). scripts/cetus_corridor_run.sh = 6 arms {cold,reactive,warm,replication,repl_final,kf_final} x 5 seeds + khonsu_ef0 x5 = 35 routes at n=5 (70 = the n=10 target we extend to later, not the n=5 count). Added a guarded chain-wait (frozen_1n_t12/_done; NOWAIT=1 standalone). Corridor bridge (atlas_corridor_bridge.sh) lands frozen1n_corridor_*.csv to mock_data; launch it when the corridor starts.
- CHAIN-WAIT BUG FIXED: the flow-arms/t12/corridor idle-waits were 14h, but capacity ~11h + flow-arms ~7h puts flow-arms _done ~18h out, so t12's 14h wait would have ABORTED before flow-arms finished (silent chain break at the t12 stage). All three waits bumped to 48h; flowarms + t12 relaunched (were still waiting, nothing lost), corridor launched. Commit "Chain waits to 48h; queue corridor after t12".

## 2026-09-10 (code session): Defect B NOT confirmed closed; the flow verify smoke was UNATTRIBUTABLE; added locale tag, re-running

CORRECTION to the Sep 9 "Defect B - FIXED" claim below (line ~12): the flow verify smoke could NOT confirm Defect B, and three re-runs left the MODESROW gap at ~77-111 ticks. Root cause of the FAILED VERIFICATION (not necessarily of the fix itself):

- The smoke's GAP metric was unattributable. MODESROW/MIG_SEAM/MIG_DBG carried NO locale tag, and both edge managers (source locale_1 = west/oncoming approach, dest locale_0 = east/conflict/ego) log into ONE file with per-edge-manager tids that COLLIDE (both start at tid=1). So "first MODESROW after crossing for cid=X" mixed source and destination tracks. The source (locale_1) emits MTR for an oncoming vehicle ~120 ticks BEFORE it crosses (cid=201 earliest MODESROW tick 132, IDENTICAL in cold and warm, because migration never touches the source), which dominated the min and made the metric read ~80 regardless of the fix. This is the SAME source-forecast confound already recorded for the FDE cold anchor (Sep 9, line ~193).
- Evidence from frozen_1m_verify/verify_warm.log (npc=201, the gating handoff: prepare 254, crossing 257, first_dst_track 255, first_use 275, warm_before_first_use=YES): only ONE track was ever seeded (MIG_SEAM tid=2, n_frames=10, n_imported=10) and it carried cid 197/199, NEVER the gating cid=201. cid=201 mapped to tids {1,4,5,6} (warm) / {4,5,6,7} (kf) with the earliest MODESROW at tick 132 in BOTH modes. The gating handoff produced no seam. Whether that is identity fragmentation (imported tid != the destination's settled tid, cf. _merge_duplicate_carla_ids) or the destination already tracking cid=201 locally cannot be told apart WITHOUT a locale tag.
- The seeding MECHANISM works for at least one track: tid=2 was seeded and produced MTR MODESROW at tick 32 (early maturity). The failure is in VERIFICATION/attribution and possibly in identity continuity at the seam, not proven in the memo_bank->trajectory rebuild itself.

FIX APPLIED THIS SESSION (scratchpad edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch.py, py_compile clean): self._locale_id from cfg['locale']['id'] in __init__ (both proxy and non-proxy paths); locale=<id> appended to [MODESROW], [MIG_SEAM], [MIG_DBG]. atlas_1m_verify.sh report rewritten: per handoff (all 3: npc 199/200/201) measure the first DESTINATION (locale=locale_0) MODESROW at/after first_dst_track_tick, GAP_vs_fdt, and list destination tids per cid (fragmentation check). Defect B closed => warm GAP_vs_fdt <= ~4 ticks (1 edge cycle), kf ~80. Attributed verify re-running on Atlas now (frozen_1m_verify/_report.txt).

RESULT (attributed verify landed, frozen_1m_verify/_report.txt): Defect B is measurably NOT closed, and the finding is worse than a maturity gap. Destination (locale_0) first MTR for the gating cid, warm vs kf: npc=199 132/162, npc=200 236/266, npc=201 (gating) 348/366 - all via local-born tids. The ONE import-created destination track (tid=2, npc=199) matures at warm 172 vs kf 174, essentially identical though warm migrated 10 frames and kf 1 -> seeding does not accelerate the imported track. The gating handoff (npc=201, first_use 277) has NO import-created destination track in either arm, so migration is INERT for the ego decision. warm ~= kf at the destination.

MECHANISM (code, confirmed): (1) the destination is locally blind to the oncoming until it enters RSU1's 50 m GT-inject range (~x=275, ~42 ticks after crossing); the migrated track exists to cover that window. (2) During the blind window the imported track has no local detection to match; the edge rebuilds trajectories each tick and PRUNES any tid not "updated" this frame (edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch _ab3d_history_to_trajs ~1841-1844: del tracked_trajectories[tid] for tid not in updated). (3) The memo_bank seeding loop requires tracked_trajectories.get(tid) to exist (~1879-1882: if _ot is None: continue), so it SKIPS the coasting imported track for EVERY blind-window tick (MIG_DBG: imported tracklet present on only 29/226 destination ticks, all post local re-detection). (4) MTR first runs on the imported track only once local detection resumes (~172 for npc=199 = near closest approach to RSU1). The tracker itself keeps unmatched tracks in tracked_tracklets while time_since_update<=coast_window=40 (tracker_wired 158-171), then moves them to lost_tracklets; but the EDGE prunes their trajectory regardless, so the seeding never fires during coasting.

FIX BUILT (v2, coast-through-blind-window; peer approved the approach, Tyler informed; edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch.py _ab3d_history_to_trajs, py_compile clean). Every cycle, for each imported track (_n_imported) present in the inner tracker's tracked OR lost set (dedup, tracked first): rebuild ot.trajectory from the memo_bank TRANSLATED so the newest frame sits at the coasted current pose (tracklet.state = predicted_last_bbox, which predict() advances from memo_bank[-1] by the migrated velocity; delta 0 when freshly observed, so no stale-handoff-pose forecast), recreate the trajectory entry if the prune removed it, and carry migrated vel/accel + gate_accel onto the obstacle so the predictor (MTR when mature, CV when immature) and the overtake gate consume it. Constraints honored: maturity is record-depth ONLY (10-frame record mature immediately; 1-frame snapshot immature until 5 frames from any source, so kf unchanged); publish gate untouched (prepared forecasts still suppressed until commit). Attributed verify RE-RUNNING; expect warm first-DST-MTR within ~1 cycle of commit, kf staying late. NOTE the constant-velocity flow verify will NOT show an outcome change (see velocity-vs-nothing below); the fix is verified by the MECHANISM (first-DST-MTR timing), the outcome payoff shows only in the maneuvering panel.

VELOCITY-VS-NOTHING (subagent forensic on landed 1k logs, answers "what produced the measured cold-vs-warm separation given neither arm had a mature migrated forecast at the decision"). ANSWER: the headline/T25 cold-vs-warm separation is "an immature constant-velocity forecast built from the transferred velocity vs NO destination track at all", NOT "10-frame history vs 1-frame snapshot". Evidence (4 independent, all agree): (1) frozen1k_headline_diag.csv, 20 runs/arm, gating cid=201: cold blind=1, vel_est_at_commit empty, collides 9/20; every migrating arm vel_est_at_commit ~12 m/s, blind=0, collides 0-2/20. (2) MATURITY CONTROL (decisive): 1-frame kf and handover_snapshot complete 0/20 IDENTICALLY to 10-frame warm despite FDE 2-3x worse (kf/snapshot fde_3s ~50-97 vs warm ~34-45); collision outcome is decoupled from forecast depth. (3) no mature migrated MTR before the decision in either arm (first_DST_MTR 348/366 vs first_use 277). (4) migration_frames: warm's dst holds track+velocity for cid=201 from tick 254; cold's dst first sees it ~313. Log level: cold-collided r1 has ZERO [PRED] lines (blind); warm-completed r1 has [HANDOFFROW] + 36 [PRED COLLISION] with kf_speed ~10.75 (CV, not MTR). IMPLICATION: the headline mechanism sentence stands (cold's rebuilt track under-speeds the oncoming; migrating arm has a velocity, cold has nothing), but the record-DEPTH story above one frame rests ENTIRELY on the maneuvering/accel panel. Raw 1k logs ARE retained: idfix_wt/evaluation_outputs/frozen_1k_camp/hl_{mode}_r{1..20}.log, cetus_t25/*.log.

GHOST-FILTER BUG (found running the v2 verify; PRE-EXISTING, affects all Mamba runs in the campaign). The v2 coast fix works at the seeding layer: all three handoffs now seed at the destination in warm (MIG_SEAM locale_0 cid=199/200/201, each n_frames=10 with real coast_dxy; kf n_frames=1), including the gating cid=201 (tid=5) that v1 never seeded. BUT the seeded track is DELETED before the predictor runs. _filter_ghost_tracks (edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch ~2088-2100, called in the handler at line 750, before the predict at 794) builds per-track speed only from self.tracker.trackers (AB3DMOT Kalman internals). The Mamba wrapper has no .trackers, so kf_vel_by_tid is empty and EVERY Mamba track reads speed 0.00, is flagged static, and is removed after 4 frames. Log: 335 [GHOST FILTER] removals in the warm run, all kf_speeds ['0.00'...], including 105 removals of the seeded gating tid=5 (real ~12 m/s migrated velocity). That is why the seeded track never stabilizes into MTR and MODESROW for cid=201 does not appear until 388 (v2 GAP_vs_fdt still ~78-95, ~= kf). Moving Mamba tracks only survive at all because _ab3d_history_to_trajs recreates them each tick from local detection. Does NOT overturn velocity-vs-nothing, and two follow-up checks (peer-requested) confirm it is transient not fragmenting: (SYMMETRY) all arms including kf run the Mamba tracker (landed hl_*_r1: mamba_dbg_rows ~1100-1200, ab3dmot_dbg_rows=0 every arm; "kf" is the 1-frame migration mode, not a Kalman tracker), ghost removals cold 617 / warm 384 / kf 379 / handoversnap 345 / reactive 371 / edgewarp 361 - kf is in the migrating-arm range so NOT a kf-vs-Mamba filter confound (cold higher because it fragments more without a migrated anchor, a downstream effect). (IDENTITY) COASTROW tid=2 steps run continuously 1..42 with no gaps, so the tracklet object (tid + memo_bank) persists through every removal - only the trajectory VIEW is deleted+recreated; identity is retained, MIG_SEAM fires once. So no landed-data re-description is needed beyond the already-planned rerun; the freeze-1m rerun still uses the corrected filter. FIX (py_compile clean): when kf_vel_by_tid has no entry for a tid, fall back to obstacle.kf_speed_mps (set by _ab3d_history_to_trajs from the track row for local tracks, from the migrated velocity for imported ones); a parked car still reads ~0 and is filtered; AB3DMOT path unchanged. Re-running attributed verify with coast + ghost-filter fixes (v3).

DEFECT B CLOSED (v3 attributed verify, coast + ghost-filter fixes; peer accepted). Evidence: (1) imported track produces MTR within ~1 cycle of commit measured ANY-cid at locale_0 - npc=199 import tid=2 first MODESROW tick 56 vs commit ~54 (+2); npc=201 import tid=4 tick 258 vs commit ~255 (+3). The ~80-160 GAP in _report.txt was a cid= FILTER artifact: the imported track transiently carries a mis-associated carla_id (197, a neighbouring flow vehicle) for ~30 MTR rows before settling on the correct cid, so filtering MODESROW on the gating cid missed the early MTR. (2) predictor classification is the direct proof: warm CVMIGRATED=0 (no warm import ever entered the immature-CV branch = mature from commit, MTR on the migrated 10 frames), kf CVMIGRATED=3 (each 1-frame import correctly immature-CV); the record-depth split, measured not inferred. (3) first_use commit+7/+8 all three handoffs. (4) ghost removals 335->54. MIG_DBG diagnostic removed; MIG_SEAM kept.

RESIDUAL (peer wants it quantified in the rerun, as columns on HANDOFFROW not a new block; it makes the paper's §7 cross-locale-identity limitation carry a number): the imported track's matched_id wobbles among the closely-spaced flow vehicles (197/199/200/201) for ~30 rows before settling. Per handoff log: does the imported track's identity at commit match the exported cid, ticks-to-settle, and whether it never settles. This is the 8 m predicted-position association gate binding to a neighbour, the §7 limitation observed live. Does NOT affect forecast availability (first_use prompt) or the outcome (velocity-vs-nothing).

IDENTITY-KEYED LANDERS (peer, when re-landing): the FDE lander AND the record-ablation + headline collision diagnostics all key on the logged carla_id; re-land them keyed on the TRACKLET identity, recording the carla_id it resolved to, so a mis-association is visible in the data rather than silently reassigning a forecast to the wrong vehicle.

DEFECT A RESOLVED AS CADENCE (measured from v3 warm log, nothing idle to remove; peer agreed to accept a "nothing idle" conclusion). Breakdown per handoff (sim ticks; 1 edge cycle = edge_dt 0.2s = 4 ticks): npc=199 commit(crossing) 55 -> publish 56 (+1) -> first_use 61 (+5) = 6; npc=201 commit 257 -> publish 258 (+1) -> first_use 263 (+5) = 6; npc=200 commit 156 -> first_use 163 = 7. Cadence boundaries: destination edge publishes MTR every edge_dt=4 ticks (MODESROW at loc0 strides 258/262/266; tracker runs every sim tick but predictor/publish on the 0.2s cadence); ego plans every ~5 ticks (EGO-DBG 260/265/270). Judgment: commit->publish=1 tick = the imported track publishes at the FIRST edge boundary after commit at the same cadence as every track (no extra hold, not idle); publish->consume=~5 ticks = the ego's first planning cycle after publish (not idle). No step waits for a boundary it does not need. The old 3.25-cycle figure was the track being INVISIBLE during coasting (=Defect B), now fixed. Defect A as a separate delivery-floor defect does NOT exist post-fix; commit->first_use ~= 2 cycles is the inherent pipeline cadence. ACTION: do not change migration DELIVERY code. TRIGGER CONSTANT KEPT AT 3 (I briefly changed it to 2, then REVERTED on the peer's call; runner_wired.py computed :644 / mtr :595 / oracle :612 all back to 3*0.2, py_compile clean, no stray). Reasoning: _fold_s = 3*0.2 (0.6s) is a DESIGN MARGIN the trigger uses to decide how early to prepare, NOT a measurement of import time. 2 cycles is the best-case (warm cache, no contention) on flow geometry; the margin exists for the loaded cases §5.8's capacity result measures (concurrent crossings push import into later cycles), and the capacity figure draws this lead as a horizontal threshold line. Shrinking to best-case removes the headroom the capacity result is about and would change trigger behaviour mid-campaign in computed/trajectory/oracle arms (invalidates a comparison for a reason unrelated to the question). PAPER (peer owns): keep the 3-cycle reservation, describe it as a margin covering import scheduling + first destination forecast under load, and ADD that the MEASURED commit-to-first-use on flow geometry is ~2 cycles, citing the rerun handoff rows (commit+first_use columns) once they land. The paper does not quote 950ms in prose (only the computed arm's capacity-figure line + trigger-table arm name); default trajectory-trigger lead = LOOKAHEAD_S. Net: no code behaviour change before the rerun.

STALE PRE-FIX SHIFT MAPPING (cetus probe a6ace70a, HEAD 4d94d420, scenario openscenario_1_accel_gt const 12, pre coast+ghost fixes; PRESERVED per peer as the record of the old blind/delivered boundary set by local re-detection; paper appendix may want the contrast). shift/mode/crossing/first_use/dec_arr/T_avail_s/dest_frames/episodes: 10 warm 69/93/125/2.80/11/0; 0 warm 86/109/125/1.95/10/0; -10 warm 103/125/125/1.10/6/2; -18 warm 116/137/120/0.20/11/0; -26 warm 130/153/135/0.25/11/0; kf mirrors warm (first_use +/-2, T_avail identical) = warm~=kf. Full report on cetus /tmp/cetus_1m_probe_report.txt.

FIXED SHIFT MAPPING DONE (Atlas frozen_1m_probe/_report.txt; peer sign-off requested). shift/mode/crossing/first_use/dec_arr/T_avail_s/boundary/episodes: 10 warm 69/75/115/2.30/delivered/0; 0 warm 86/91/140/2.70/delivered/0; -10 warm 103/109/110/0.35/delivered/0; -18 warm 116/121/115/-0.05/BLIND/0; -26 warm 130/133/135/0.25/delivered/0; kf mirrors (10:73, 0:89, -10:107, -18:119, -26:133; -26 kf BLIND at T_avail 0.00). KEY RESULT: commit->first_use dropped from ~23 ticks stale (24/23/22/21/23) to ~5 ticks fixed (6/5/6/5/3) = ~0.9s faster delivery; the blind/delivered boundary moved from ~T_avail 1.15s (old, set by local re-detection under the coasting-prune defect) to ~T_avail 0-0.25s (fixed, set by commit + ~5-tick/~1.25-cycle delivery). System now tolerates a decision ~0.9s closer to the crossing before going blind = exactly the maneuvering panel's shortest points. episodes 0 in every cell (velocity-vs-nothing holds at the boundary); warm~=kf (first_use within ~2 ticks). CAVEAT: single-seed probe, T_avail axis has dec_arr run-to-run noise (the -18 warm blind / -26 warm delivered pair is a dec_arr 115-vs-135 artifact, not a real inversion); the maneuvering PANEL for the paper needs multiple seeds. Note: accel scenario uses the LIVE accel runner (runner_wired overlays flow only), but the Defect B fixes are in the edge manager (overlaid for both), so the fixed destination behavior applies.

SHIFT MAPPING SIGNED OFF (peer). Consequence: the boundary moved to ~T_avail 0, so the OLD maneuvering shift set {10,0,-10,-18,-26} is now 4/5 in the delivered region (flat panel). NEW MANEUVERING SHIFT SET APPROVED (7 points): {0,-5,-11,-17,-22,-26,-30} -> predicted T_avail {1.95,1.53,1.02,0.52,0.10,-0.24,-0.58} (shift 0 = delivered anchor so the plateau is visible; 3 transition, 1 boundary, 2 blind). From crossing = 85.9 - 1.69*shift, dec_arr ~125 (shift-independent), T_avail = 1.95 + 0.085*shift. TEN SEEDS PER SHIFT (peer: do NOT trim; dec_arr spread 110-140 ~ point spacing at the boundary, so points interleave into a band not a ladder; enough seeds make the transition visible). Report REALISED per-run T_avail per shift when the sweep lands (check the 7 operating points spread vs bunch). LANDER RULE (confirmed by design): the maneuvering lander (not yet built) computes T_avail PER-RUN = (dec_arr - crossing)*0.05 from that run's own EGO-DBG (first tick ego x<=307) + HANDOFFROW crossing_tick, never a nominal per-shift value; shift only selects the operating point, dec_arr noise scatters points along the real axis. HANDOFFROW already has crossing+first_use; only the identity-settling columns are new.

ORDERED pre-campaign work (peer): (1) Defect A - DONE (cadence, no code change; trigger 3-cycle reservation KEPT as design margin, paper adds measured ~2-cycle commit-to-first-use); (2) shift mapping - DONE (fixed re-derivation signed off; new maneuvering shift set proposed); (3) relay smoke - PASSED (atlas_relay_smoke.sh, frozen_1m_relay/_report.txt). All 4 cells (0/3/20/50 ms): xferrows=6, fallbacks=0, runs completed (RUNROW episodes=0, 3 handoffs). Transfer time tracks the wire: commit_ms 0.43/3.63/20.92/50.71 = ~1x one-way delay + 0.5 base; prepare_ms 1.14/4.91/27.72/67.77 (higher: payload RPC + gRPC framing + first-transfer connection setup). Used PORT-FILTERED netem (delay only egress to dport 50771) so CARLA loopback comms undelayed -> scales at ~1x one-way, not 2x round-trip; asked peer whether the §5.1/§5.8 transport figure wants round-trip (add a sport-50771 filter + rerun). Audit defect FIXED and measured: relay carries real bytes, no parametric substitution.

ROUND-TRIP RELAY RE-RUN PASSED (frozen_1m_relay/_report.txt @03:46:51): sport+dport 50771 filters both delay the RPC, CARLA untouched. commit_ms now = 2x one-way almost exactly: 0.98/6.71/40.78/100.75 ms for 0/3/20/50 ms one-way (expect 0/6/40/100). prepare_ms 1.07/8.83/54.39/134.45 (higher: payload+gRPC framing+first-transfer setup) but scales. All cells xferrows=6, fallbacks=0, eval_done=1; 50 ms round trip did NOT break scenario timing so sweep range is full 0-50. Transport figure x-axis now = paper's one-way fibre latency spent as a round trip. Audit defect FULLY closed. LAUNCH LESSON: sudo/pkill in the LAUNCHING Bash command is sandbox-denied (exit 1, empty output); launch with a bare `bash script > file` (cleanup/sudo/tc live INSIDE the script, runs fine backgrounded).

IDENTITY-SETTLING INSTRUMENTATION BUILT (for the campaign, py_compile clean): factories_1l stamps t._migrated_cid = latent.persistent_vehicle_id (exported cid); edge_manager seeding loop emits [MIG_IDENT] locale/tid/migrated_cid/resolved_cid/match per pass. The maneuvering + headline landers reduce it (anchor each line to the nearest EGO-DBG tick like CAMIGRATED) to identity_at_commit_matches / ticks_to_settle / settled per handoff vs crossing_tick = §7 cross-locale-identity limitation quantified. Still to add before those blocks: identity-KEY the FDE/record/headline landers (key on tracklet identity, record resolved carla_id).

PRE-CAMPAIGN GATE CLEAR (all 3 ordered items done). The freeze-1m whole-campaign rerun is unblocked from the code side (Defect A/B, shift mapping, transport). Launch order (peer): regions/maneuvering block FIRST, then headline+record, then loaded pair, then corridor+tail. STANDING: first-run degeneracy check per block (stop+report at run 3 not 70). Report each block's landing + rule scores incrementally.

CAMPAIGN STARTED, maneuvering block CALIBRATION (first-run checks caught two things before the sweep, exactly as intended):
- SMOKE (shift=-17 a=3.0): fix CONFIRMED on accel (warm CVMIGRATED=0 mature-at-commit, kf=1 CV; MIG_SEAM warm=10/kf=1; MIG_IDENT live 118/80). But degenerate: gate saw cid=-1 clear=inf -> GO both, no conflict. Cause: accel makes the oncoming cross ~22 ticks EARLY (crossing 93 vs const-12's ~115) and speed past; the const-12 shift set is mis-calibrated under accel.
- RE-MAP (a=3.0, shifts -10..-70, frozen_1m_accremap/_report.txt): the maneuvering operating point is ~shift -40 (gate faces the approaching oncoming). MECHANISM CONFIRMED: warm gate reads accel_src=migrated meet_spd 23.6/31.7/33.7 at shifts -25/-40/-55 (SEES the accel via migrated history + forecast-consuming gate); kf reads accel_src=none (CV, no meet_spd). warm != kf at the FORECAST level = the coast+gate fix payoff. BUT no OUTCOME separation: every cell GO, episodes=0 both arms - a=3.0 is not tight enough to make kf's CV mistiming cost the run.
- CORRECTION: warm DID WAIT at a=3.0 shift-40 (accel_src=migrated meet_spd=31.7 clear=42 -> WAIT); the re-map report's tail -1 hid it behind the post-pass clear=inf GO. So warm != kf at the DECISION already at a=3.0 (warm WAITs, kf GOes CV); what's missing is the OUTCOME flip (both complete).
- DECISIONS SETTLED (peer/Tyler): (1) ACCEL = one level (not crossed), pick the lowest that diverges; running the a in {4,5,6} magnitude probe at shift-40 (b850qtsdz) to find the lowest accel where kf's GO collides/times-out (closed-loop) vs completes-with-margin (geometry-limited -> move decision point, not raise a to the limit). Report per cell/arm: decision gate line (GO/WAIT, accel_src, meet_spd, clear), min finite ttc (closest approach), episodes. (2) SEEDS = Tyler chose the PAIRED SPAWN-PHASE seed. BUILT (scenario_1_1l.py): KHONSU_SEED index -> random.Random(seed).uniform(-band,band) offset on the oncoming stream spawn x (paired across arms, seed 0=base), band=KHONSU_SEED_BAND_M default 4m, [SEEDROW] logged. Seed check queued (b6dlghbzo): seeds 1/2/3 warm + s1 kf @ flow shift0, verify pairing + band moves T_avail without flipping regime; tune band if needed. Every block (headline/regions/loaded/corridor) uses the seed once confirmed.
ACCEL-MAG RESULT (b850qtsdz, a{4,5,6} x {warm,kf} @ shift-40, single seed, frozen_1m_accelmag/_report.txt): magnitude is NOT a deterministic lever - NO collision at any accel to 6 (episodes=0, contact=0 all). But NOT comfortable-for-both (the weak story) either: at a=5 shift-40, warm min_TTC 1.60s / 0 near-miss ticks (comfortable, saw the accel, timed the pass) vs kf min_TTC 0.05s / 15 ticks under 0.3s (GOes on CV accel_src=none, sustains a razor-thin near-miss, does not quite collide at this seed). So the mechanism separates at the OUTCOME margin: warm comfortable, kf on the edge. Single-seed margins erratic (warm 0.1/1.60/0.1 at a=4/5/6; kf ~0.05 throughout) => the panel MUST be a SUCCESS RATE over paired seeds (kf's 0.05s margin tips to collision on some seeds, warm's does not). This is the peer's fallback = the better figure, needs no extreme accel or deterministic collision. PROPOSED maneuvering panel: a=5 shift-40 warm vs kf x 20 paired seeds -> success rate (completed-without-collision) + min-TTC margin distribution per arm; lower to a=4 if it also separates on the spread. Seed check (b6dlghbzo) running to confirm the band first.
ACCEL-CONSUMPTION DEFECT (found via warm's erratic margins; peer-approved fix built): warm's accel awareness was flaky (accel_src none/local/migrated across a=4/5/6) because the gate ALWAYS re-estimated the accel LOCALLY per-tick (_estimate_accel_mps2 on the current memo_bank) and only LABELED it 'migrated' when it coincidentally matched _migrated_accel_mps2. Same defect class as the maturity one: the record carries the value, the consumer re-derives it. FIX (edge_manager coast-seeding loop + factories, py_compile clean): use the transferred _migrated_accel_mps2 DIRECTLY as gate_accel while the destination has < LOCAL_ACCEL_THRESH(5) of its OWN local frames since import (new _n_local_since_import counter, init 0 at import, incremented when the imported track is in `updated`), then hand over to the local estimate; accel_src names what was USED (migrated/local/none); [GATE_ACCEL] logs used + src + migrated + local_est + n_local every decision (divergence visible) and marks the HANDOVER tick. VELOCITY CHECK (peer-requested, CLEAN): the gate uses obs.kf_speed_mps directly (behavior_agent:1191), which the coast-seeding loop sets from _migrated_vel_mps for imported tracks, so velocity IS consumed as transferred during coasting (local KF only after re-detection = natural handover); the one position-diff speed re-estimate (behavior_agent:879) is the emergency backstop on the forecast, not the go/no-go. So accel was the only re-derived consumer.
SEED CHECK DONE (frozen_1m_seedcheck): PAIRING PASS (warm-s1 == kf-s1 spawn_offset -2.925m, identical across arms). Band +/-4m moves the geometry correctly (offsets -2.9/+3.6/-2.1 across seeds 1/2/3 -> crossing 262/251/260, positive offset=toward conflict=earlier crossing, ~11 tick spread). The report's T_avail ~-5s "blind" is a wrong-cid CHECK artifact (tail -1 paired the ego decision ~140 with the LAST oncoming's crossing ~262 in the 3-oncoming flow, not the gating cid) - the seed itself is correct. BAND SET = 4m; the clean per-seed T_avail sample comes from the panel (accel shift-40, single gating oncoming). Natural dec_arr noise (110-140, ~1.5s) already dominates; the band adds a controlled sample on top.
RE-CHECK DONE (frozen_1m_accelrecheck, a{4,5} shift-40): ACCEL FIX WORKS mechanically - warm gate_accel CONSISTENT (used=5.96 every decision, src=migrated first frames then logged handover to local; migrated=5.96 == local_est=5.96 so the value agrees, the fix's gain is reliability not a new number), kf src=none. BUT NO DIFFERENTIATION: BOTH arms WAIT (kf decision accel_src=none meet_spd=25.9 clear=38 -> WAIT). kf WAITs because by the time it LOCALLY detects the oncoming it has ALREADY accelerated to ~25.9 m/s (constant-accel-from-spawn over the long runway from far-west shift-40), so kf's CV on the high CURRENT speed is itself conservative and correctly waits. For kf to be WRONG (panel premise) it must see the oncoming SLOW (~12) so its CV underestimates, then the oncoming accelerates. shift-40 gives the opposite (pre-accelerated). ROOT = GEOMETRY (peer's other lever): the operating point must place the ego decision while the oncoming is still near initial speed with accel building before the conflict. Levers: (a) less-negative shift (closer/later-triggered oncoming, slow at decision); (b) lower ONCOMING_SPEED; (c) delayed accel onset (trends toward the removed exogenous step). DEFERRED to peer/Tyler (scenario-geometry call).

GEOMETRY PROBE DONE (frozen_1m_geom, peer design: initial speed {4,6,8} PRIMARY x shift {-20,-40} secondary, a=5 from spawn, VCAP=16; 12 cells): DEFINITIVE - NO slow-at-decision operating point. kf's gate meet_spd (= oncoming CURRENT speed at the ego decision) is 15.4-15.9 m/s in EVERY cell, even at initial v0=4. With a=5 the oncoming reaches the VCAP(16) in ~2.4s, shorter than the runway from these shifts, so it is at the cap BEFORE the decision; kf reads ~15.6 and correctly WAITs, no CV underestimate, both arms WAIT, episodes=0 all. The initial-speed lever cannot overcome a=5's rise. So the CLOSED-LOOP (collision / success-rate) maneuvering panel is NOT achievable in this scenario -> take the agreed forecast-quality exit (do NOT extend the sweep to hunt a collision, per peer). REFINEMENT: VCAP=16 also made the accel COMPLETE by the decision (constant at cap) -> removes even the FORECAST divergence (warm & kf both project constant ~16). The forecast-quality signal needs the oncoming STILL ACCELERATING at the decision = UNCAPPED; the accel-mag probe (a=5 shift-40 no cap) showed it: warm meet_spd 60.4 (accel-aware) vs kf 25.9 (CV) = clear forecast divergence, both WAIT. So the FORECAST-QUALITY maneuvering panel = UNCAPPED a=5, warm-vs-kf meet_spd/FDE distribution across paired seeds, outcome does-not-separate (honest). SEED PAIRING CONFIRMED (warm-s1 == kf-s1 offset -2.925). AWAITING peer framing: forecast-quality panel on uncapped a=5 (FDE/meet_spd distribution), or reconsider the maneuvering scenario. The accel fix + paired seed are sound; the maneuvering panel's NATURE (forecast-quality, not closed-loop) is the resolved finding - it settles the multi-session back-and-forth: at these speeds/accels a CV read is never wrong enough at the decision to cost the run.

PEER REJECTED the uncapped framing (warm 60.4 m/s = 217 km/h = unbounded extrapolation, wrong vs GT in the other direction; not forecast quality). New lever = LOWER ACCEL. LOW-ACCEL PROBE RUNNING (ba7ajl5l9, peer FOUR CELLS, do not extend): a in {1.5,2,2.5,3}, v0=4, shift-40, VCAP=16 kept, warm+kf. Goal: find the lowest a still ACCELERATING at the decision ((16-4)/a > runway~4s => a<3). Records per cell: speed at decision, speed at conflict, still_accel bool, gate per arm, min_ttc, episodes, and FDE vs GROUND TRUTH per arm (fde3/fde5 via the FDE lander run per-log, MODESROW endpoint vs actual timeline). OUTCOMES: (a) an a with still_accel=YES -> operating point, panel runs there over paired seeds, warm FDE < kf FDE vs GT reported plainly as a few metres (not 35); (b) NO still_accel a -> HONEST NEGATIVE: at realistic accels in this geometry the vehicle is at cap by the decision, CV already correct, this closed-loop scenario cannot exercise the maneuvering region; maneuvering evidence rests on the OFFLINE Kalman-vs-state-space microbenchmark, regions claim qualified to "velocity snapshot sufficient across the whole closed-loop range we can construct" (a defensible result; a manufactured one is not). ~50 min; report table, peer picks operating point or accepts the negative.

REFRAME (peer, backed by Tyler; SUPERSEDES the honest-negative lean - the panel IS achievable, wrong knob): the lever is the acceleration ONSET, not the magnitude. scenario_1_1l.py's accel branch runs ConstantAccelWaypointFollower right after trigger_behavior = InTriggerDistanceToLocation(EGO, TRIGGER_DIST=300), so the oncoming accelerates for the WHOLE ego approach and is at the cap by the decision regardless of a. The low-accel probe confirms this (at-cap every a). FIX: an ENDOGENOUS acceleration onset - cruise slow then accelerate, keyed on the ONCOMING's own route position, not the ego. SCENARIO CHANGE BUILT (scenario_1_1l.py, py_compile clean): new branch active when ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET set - WaypointFollower(ONCOMING_CRUISE=5) until the ACTOR reaches x=ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET (InTriggerDistanceToLocation on `actor`), then ConstantAccelWaypointFollower FROM the cruise speed at ONCOMING_ACCEL, cap ONCOMING_VCAP. Actor-keyed = endogenous (not the quarantined ego-keyed STEP); the source observes the first frames of the rise (history to migrate); the ego decides while slow (CV: ~12s to arrival on the 5 m/s read -> GO; history: ~5s true -> WAIT; the gap flips the gate). This is the queue-tail/stop-line-departure case (paper 2.3), physical not manufactured. PLAN: low-accel cells measure the runway (where the decision lands) -> set the onset; then SWEEP ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET at a=3, cruise=5, cap=16, warm+kf, find where kf=GO / warm=WAIT, report speed-at-decision + still_accel + gate/arm + FDE-vs-GT/arm + min_ttc + outcome. WHOLE maneuvering block reruns on the new scenario; capped-spawn-onset runs do NOT mix in. Keep cruise 4-6, a 2-3, cap 16 (physical).

RUNWAY MEASURED (low-accel cells, the gating number): the WINDOW DOES NOT EXIST at the current conflict position. Timing (warm, ticks): a=1.5 prepare161/cross166/first_use173; a=2 146/152/157; a=2.5 137/143/149; a=3 132/138/143 - but the ego LAUNCHES (do_ov) at tick 135 in EVERY cell, and its decision (x<=307) is 135. So the oncoming's first_use (delivery to the ego) is 143-173, ALWAYS 0.4-1.9s AFTER the ego has already launched. The ego commits the overtake before the slow oncoming is migrated (prepare 132-161) or crossed (138-166) or delivered (first_use 143-173); the gate sees no threat at 135 -> GO, and the migration cannot gate a decision that already happened. The two-sided window fails: the late bound (slow at decision) forces the vehicle far/late, pushing delivery past the ego's fixed launch. FALLBACK (peer): MOVE THE CONFLICT so the ego launches ~0.5-2s later (past first_use ~145-175) instead of at 135; that is the truck/overtake-zone position or the ego approach = peer/Tyler scenario call. HELD for the conflict-geometry steer; NOT launching the onset sweep (window absent). REPRODUCIBILITY (peer, acknowledged): the endogenous-onset change + ALL freeze-1m code (coast/ghost/accel-consumption fixes, paired seed) are SCRATCHPAD-ONLY (repo scenario_1.py has 0 ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET), applied at runtime by the probe scripts (cp + trap-restore over the frozen base 71c9f37e). Must land on develop with EXPLICIT pathspecs before the block runs at a named tag; will land once the scenario is finalized (post conflict-move), or land the non-scenario fixes now if peer prefers.

UPDATE (headline ordering FINE + landing done + lever = cross-earlier):
- HEADLINE/RECORD-ABLATION ordering is FINE (peer's higher-priority check, existing logs): the ego LAUNCHES at 270-445 while the oncoming stream is delivered (first_use) by 267-277, so launch is AT/AFTER delivery (mostly 100+ ticks after; fa_hist2 445, fa_hist5 390, hl_kf 435). The ego HAS the forecast when it decides. The record-depth null (1-frame==10-frame) is NOT an ordering defect - it is CV==MTR at constant 12 m/s (no accel to capture). So the record-depth-above-one-frame claim genuinely rests on the maneuvering panel, and the headline/record campaign plan STANDS (no geometry change). Only the maneuvering scenario needs the fix.
- LANDING DONE (peer priority, PUSHED): settled non-scenario overlays committed to freeze_1m_overlay/ (021aeb88, peer pushed it - my commit was local-only) + apply/restore script freeze_1m_overlay/apply.sh (18f103ee, I pushed; origin/develop=18f103ee). README maps 11 overlays to base paths at 71c9f37e; peer verified byte-identity. scenario_1_1l.py HELD (mid-edit onset); lands into freeze_1m_overlay when the first maneuvering cell runs (file coherent) + uncomment its apply.sh MAP line. POST-DEADLINE: per-fix base merge into develop source (task #38 area) so develop is not left carrying the bugs.
- LEVER (peer): make the oncoming CROSS EARLIER, not move the conflict (moving the conflict changes the ego route + breaks comparability). Endogenous-onset scenario built (ONCOMING_CRUISE + ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET, actor-keyed). MANEUVER v2 PROBE RUNNING (bgh7e2wf0): cruise=5 a=2 cap=16 shift=-10, onset x in {245,235,225} x {kf,warm}; target time_available ~+1.5s (crossing before decision), oncoming slow at decision (kf CV underestimate -> GO, warm accel-aware -> WAIT). Report kf GO? + distance-to-conflict at decision + crossing-vs-decision from the first coherent cell before the rest; if cross-earlier can't reach +1.5s, report by how much -> move conflict.
- ON245 RESULT (first cell, measured; the onset knob CANNOT reach the window, geometry change required): the probe report's x<=307 "decision" proxy is WRONG for the accel scenario; read do_ov=True (real overtake commit). kf: do_ov=True at TICK 130 (ego x=306.7), gate logs cid=-1 meet_spd=None clear=inf -> GO (a BLIND GO, no oncoming visible at commit). Oncoming npc=199 spawns x=200 at tick 13, cruises 5 m/s; at the decision (130) it is x~229, ~49 m from the conflict (278), still PRE-onset (onset x=245). It does not cross the migration boundary until crossing_tick=204, first_use=207. So crossing (204) is 74 ticks / 3.7 s AFTER the decision (130); delivery (207) is 77 ticks after. The forecast does not exist when either arm decides. kf COLLIDES: episodes=1, min_ttc=0.15, ego brakes 11->1.1 m/s at tick 180-195 sitting at x~279.7 when the oncoming arrives. warm outcome pending (min_ttc 0.4 so far). WHY THE SWEEP CANNOT HELP: crossing_tick is governed by spawn (x=200) + cruise (5 m/s), both FIXED across the onset sweep; ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET only sets where accel begins, and 245/235/225 are all at/ahead of the oncoming's position at the decision (x~229), so none move the crossing before the decision. The two-sided window (crossed+delivered before commit AND slow at the conflict when the ego arrives) is geometrically unreachable at spawn x=200 / cruise 5 / ego-do_ov 130. FIX IS GEOMETRY (deferred to peer/Tyler): either spawn the oncoming much closer to the boundary so it crosses by ~120 while slow, OR delay the ego overtake trigger to ~195 so it commits when the oncoming is delivered (207) and accelerating into the conflict. Panel NOT launched; atlas_maneuver_panel.sh parked (env-parameterized by ONSET/spawn/trigger so a geometry retune does not touch it); 235/225 cells add no info (same crossing ~204).
- REVERSAL (Tyler via peer, Sep 10; STOP the maneuvering geometry work): the closed-loop maneuvering COLLISION panel was never load-bearing for the record-depth claim, and Tyler pushed back that being unable to make it vary is not a result. The record-depth claim rests on TWO measured, clean results that already exist: (1) the closed-loop RECORD ABLATION - nothing 1/10, box-no-velocity 2/10, ONE-frame-with-velocity 9/10, two-frame 10/10, full record 20/20; the large effect is carrying VELOCITY AT ALL, not depth. One-frame-vs-ten does NOT separate in closed loop and the paper already says so (knee at 2 frames; differences above 1 frame within a small ablation's run-to-run variation; it does NOT claim a 10-frame closed-loop requirement). (2) the OFFLINE FORCED-HANDOFF depth benchmark across 4 maneuvers: one-step error 3-8x larger with 1 frame than full history (straight: 0.250 m nothing, 0.205 m 1-frame, 0.009 m 2-frame). Depth result exists and works, offline. So the boundary retune / onset sweep / low-accel / geometry probes were all chasing a panel the paper does not need. Geometry work HALTED: probe killed, files restored, boundary YAML overlay (accel_gt_yaml_1m.yaml, locale split 250->235) left PARKED in scratchpad UNCOMMITTED and unused. cid=-1-at-decision = void-cell filter still a good standing rule if any accel cell is ever run. Fate of the projected-acceleration panel (keep/drop from paper) is Tyler's call, peer owns that conversation.
- LANDED (peer directive, PUSHED 47a327f3): scenario_1_1l.py (paired seed SETTLED + endogenous-onset branch INERT unless ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET set) and atlas_maneuver_panel.sh into freeze_1m_overlay/; apply.sh MAP uncommented for scenario_1_1l.py; README updated (scenario safe for headline/record/corridor blocks that don't set onset; panel parked pending Tyler). Paired seed no longer unversioned.
- NEXT (peer): return to the freeze-1m campaign in PLANNED ORDER starting with the REGIONS block. AWAITING peer confirmation of the concrete regions runner + metric: my notes tie "regions" to the 7-shift x 10-seed maneuvering T_avail sweep (shift {0,-5,-11,-17,-22,-26,-30}, T_avail 1.95..-0.58, per-run T_avail=(dec_arr-crossing)*0.05), which used the maneuvering scenario now deprioritized. Confirm whether regions is measured by FDE (kept, offline-consistent) vs collision success (dropped), and whether it uses the accel scenario or shift-only const-velocity, before launching Carla.
- REGIONS RESOLVED + CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED (Tyler/peer, Sep 10 - the earlier "regions=shift sweep" note is SUPERSEDED). Regions figure = TWO panels sharing one runner/lander/figure: TOP = constant-speed oncoming, BOTTOM = realistic-driving (the acceleration block). Independent variable is VEHICLE SPEED at fixed geometry (6,8,12,16,20,24 m/s), NOT shift. Y = runs completed WITHOUT collision (success), not FDE. FDE is its own separate block (needs MODESROW + a no-handoff reference arm; do NOT reconstruct from T25). Canonical path = T25: runner adapted from cetus_t25_rerun.sh -> scripts/atlas_t25_1m.sh, lander scripts/khonsu_t25_land.py (added "oracle" arm). Arms = cold, kf (velocity snapshot), reactive, warm (Khonsu), oracle (=warm + TRIGGER_MODE=oracle, GT-crossing trigger, T20 upper bound). Paired KHONSU_SEED, seeds 1-5 across the WHOLE grid first then extend to 10 (Wilson intervals need 10). Parallelize: REGIONS on atlas, CORRIDOR on cetus, concurrent.
- ATLAS regions TOP (constant) RUNNING: scripts/atlas_t25_1m.sh in idfix_wt (freeze-1m overlay), 5-seed grid (6spd x5arm), seed-major. Landing loop atlas_t25_landloop.sh re-lands frozen1m_t25_rows.csv into ~/repos/scale_out_nsdi/mock_data every 10 min (column-identical to frozengen_t25_rows.csv, keyed on the central lock). Smoke warm v12 s1: completed, NO collision, gate saw the vehicle (cid=201, meet_spd 11.8, NOT blind), crossing 262/delivery 269 << do_ov 415 (ordering fine). Standing void filter: gate cid=-1 at the decision = void cell, all arms.
- CETUS corridor RUNNING (2-host): worktree ~/cetus_1m_wt at 71c9f37e + freeze_1m_overlay via apply.sh + corridor files (all on develop now, runner .py committed 56d50c20). THREE infra gaps found+fixed on cetus (git-lfs not installed there): (1) worktree checkout writes LFS POINTERS for .pth models - peer placed real files (mtr 624M, wf 64.7M, mamba 53M), and note the MAIN thresh02 entries are SYMLINKS to atlas paths (cp -r would dangle); (2) MTR CUDA ext attention_cuda.so / knn_cuda.so are BUILD artifacts absent in a fresh checkout - cp'd the 4 .so from MAIN ops into the worktree, import verified; (3) corridor runner .py was untracked (peer committed). Runner scripts/cetus_corridor_run.sh (run-only, does NOT touch the peer's models/worktree) via tmux session "corridor", 70 routes (6arm x5 + khonsu ef0 x5, extend to 10). SSH to cetus: tlandle@143.215.184.49 (NOT tlandle3), RTX 3080 Ti.
- FOURTH gap + a 5th (launch): (4) UNTRACKED Swin backbone CMP/MTR/pretrained/swin-base-patch4-window7-224 (332M) absent in the worktree -> code silently fell back to a HuggingFace download (401, loud - but a SUCCESSFUL download would have run a different backbone = silent divergence); cp'd from MAIN. (5) my ssh-command-line "pkill -f cetus_corridor_run.sh" was matching + killing its OWN invoking shell (self-match) -> use tmux kill-session, never pkill-by-script-name from the command line. verify_models.sh guard (peer 57af285a: size+md5 of all 4 artefacts) now fronts BOTH runners (commit 3452f375); atlas idfix_wt verified all-ok.
- CORRIDOR TIMEOUT DEFECT (important, schedule): the 900s outer timeout (fine for flow/T25) KILLED every corridor route mid-run -> RUNROW=0, zero usable corridor data until fixed. Measured: route reaches tick 1900 (ego x=92.3, dest x=-80, ~55%) in 900s, so a full route needs ~3400 ticks ~27 min wall (3 locales of WorldFusion+MTR per tick across ~385m on the 3080 Ti). FIX: timeout 900->2100s, restarted (commit ad21de1c). SCHEDULE: corridor route ~30 min incl restart = ~6x the flow-class ~5 min. The 294 runs/day/host rate is FLOW-CLASS ONLY. Corridor block: n=5 ~0.7 d, n=10 ~1.5 d on cetus (dedicated -> ~Sep 12, fits). Campaign must be re-costed in two runtime classes (flow ~5min, heavy ~30min: corridor + likely capacity/burst), not one flat rate; atlas flow-class load (regions 600 at n=10 + faults/transport/visible/age/overlap/trigger/alternatives/record) is now the longer pole ~4 d. Full 2-class projection + per-host rebalance delivered to peer: both hosts finish ~Sep 14-15 (cetus corridor->Sep 12/13 then joins flow; atlas flow ~66h). 1 run/host FIXED (4080S 94% GPU-bound). capacity/burst MEASURE one cell before costing (do not assume flow-class).
- CORRIDOR DATA FIXES (peer-caught, all lander/stale-file, NO rerun; commit 76563ebe): (1) SCHEMA: frozen1m_corridor_rows.csv was 26 cols vs frozengen 30. khonsu_corridor_land.py now emits frozengen column-for-column (diff-verified): renamed traffic->traffic_n, n_crossings->crossings; added band/refresh/mirror/look/rep/eps_raw/contact_raw/oncoming_speed/trigger_dist/final_update (RUNROW parse + LAUNCHENV + warm-final rule) + dual_fuse_ms/dual_predict_ms (mean of DUALROW fuse_ms/predict_ms). NO gen col obsolete. (2) EMPTY crossings + (3) WRONG-arm row (co_warm eps0) were BOTH the STALE SMOKE cell: cetus_corridor_1m.sh SMOKE=1 left co_warm_n1_r1.log (16:15, 48KB, pre-fix early-failure) in the corridor dir -> the bridge landed it (crossings-less, wrong arm) AND its RUNROW would make the clean run SKIP warm_r1. LESSON: SMOKE runs leave stale logs that both contaminate landing and trip the RUNROW skip; delete smoke logs before the real run (or SMOKE to a separate dir). Deleted it; clean run re-does warm_r1. cold_r1 verified: RUNROW + 9 crossings + episodes=1 (cold collides, expected RQ4). (4) Corridor-only epoch-fencing metrics (stale_owner_consumed, both_emit_window_ticks, route_success): peer's call = PROMOTE all three into the main 33-col schema (already columns in the multi-ego schema; side files get forgotten), side file dropped. frozen1m 33-col order = the 30 + route_success, stale_owner_consumed, both_emit_window_ticks appended; peer regenerates frozengen to match. Commits 76563ebe (30-col) -> bffb968a (33-col) -> 329f43db/790d8867 (empty-for-non-migrating).
- CORRIDOR EPOCH-METRIC SIGNAL (non-obvious): the migration signal is CAMIGRATED, NOT CONSUMEDEPOCH. cold logs 15411 CONSUMEDEPOCH (every LOCAL track epoch read) + PUBGATE_SRC=0 + CAMIGRATED=0; so CONSUMEDEPOCH/PUBGATE presence does NOT mean migration. stale_owner_consumed + both_emit_window_ticks are emitted EMPTY (not 0/artifact) on non-migrating arms (cold): 0 would read as "not migrating is as well-fenced as fencing" and both_emit's else-branch emits a spurious open window (cold showed 1298). Lander: _migrates = "CAMIGRATED" in text.
- CORRIDOR FIRST RESULTS: cold_r1 collided (episodes=1, route_success=no, epoch cols empty). reactive_r1 (fenced, CAMIGRATED=3): stale_owner_consumed=56, both_emit=2129, collided=YES, crossings=3 - a fenced arm with 56 stale reads; OPEN Q to peer: is reactive fenced or a deliberately-unfenced baseline? The load-bearing number is warm/khonsu fenced (expect 0), warm_r1 running now (watcher bcano7cua). A transient python SIGABRT hit one cell (recovered by the run() retry; GPU 6.2/12GB not OOM); watch for recurrence, hard-fail guard stops the block if a cell fails both attempts.
- WF PHANTOM-STALL FAILURE MODE (major, corridor HELD, may hit regions + headline): the corridor collisions are NOT cooperative-prediction failures. Diagnosed: cold_r1==reactive_r1 byte-identical (both stall tick 1085, pos (103.5,202), 1110 contact ticks) => planner insensitive to snapshot-vs-cold. The contact obstacle is a WorldFusion PHANTOM: carla_id=-1, obs_speed 0, NO GT actor at its position, a CLUSTER at x~100-104 y~199 (oncoming lane). The ego brakes for it and is stuck. Root cause of non-removal: _filter_ghost_tracks removes static(<0.5) tracks after 4 CONSECUTIVE frames keyed by track_id, but the phantom churns track_ids (17 ids in a 3m band), resetting the per-tid counter => never removed. FIX (committed 206192bc): location-keyed removal of static UNMAPPED (carla_id=-1) phantoms (spatial cell, 8 frames), SCOPED to carla_id=-1 so real mapped vehicles (incl the headline blocker) are never deleted. Diag scripts: scripts/diag_corridor_contact.py (ego stall + contact actor), scripts/diag_corridor_stale_split.py.
- ESCALATION: the SAME carla_id=-1 phantoms are in the freeze-1m REGIONS logs (5-633/cell; by-construction inertness FAILED, peer's zero-phantom check was one mid-run log) AND the freeze-1k T25 cold cells STALL on carla_id=-1 phantoms too (t25_cold_v12_s1: stuck 485 ticks behind carla_id=-1 at (291,199)). HEADLINE IS CLEAN (peer found direct evidence, phantom hypothesis REFUTED for it): frozen1k_headline_diag.csv has collision_partner_resolved, 120 rows, every collision resolves to a REAL actor (no-transfer 9 collisions: 6 vs actor 201 oncoming, 3 vs 198 truck; history-at-crossing 2 vs 198), ZERO carla_id=-1. Arithmetic closes to the printed 7/20. So the headline separation is FORECAST-driven, centrepiece stands. The phantom problem is CONFINED to T25 + corridor (geometry the headline scenario never reaches). CAVEAT still applies to REGIONS: a phantom-stall may be the CONSEQUENCE of the no-forecast plan (cold plans worse -> reaches the phantom; velocity arms avoid it), so the separation could still be migration-driven there. ARBITER (running on cetus tmux "arbiter", watcher b2m6uimc9): t25_cold_v20_s1 OLD vs NEW edge_manager, same host. If NEW (phantom removed) flips cold to COMPLETE -> collisions were phantom artifacts (regions grid + headline interpretation both affected, big rerun). If cold STILL fails -> separation is real, fix is inert-ish, only corridor reruns. DECIDES regions-restart + headline. Atlas regions UNTOUCHED pending the readout.
- CORRECTION + HOST CONFOUND (latest, ALL DECISIONS HELD): (a) CORRIDOR collision partner is REAL, not a phantom: collision_partner_resolved (added to corridor lander, col 37, graceful kad import) = actor 199 = the stopped carlacola BLOCKER at x=120 (y=195.4, ego lane, not in CORRIDORCROSS). So the corridor collision is a REAR-END into the stopped blocker; my "contact is a phantom" was wrong (conflated the phantom the predictor braked for with the physical hit). Conclusion unchanged: cold=reactive=warm rear-end 199 identically => success != cooperative prediction; corridor stands on epoch-fencing + continuity. (b) PHANTOM CAUSAL CHAIN (peer, plausible): blocker x=120 (ego lane) + phantom x=100-104 in the ONCOMING lane (the overtake space) => ego pulls out (do_ov=True tick 365, reaches y~198 oncoming lane near x=100), phantom in the overtake lane aborts the manoeuvre => rear-ends the blocker. So the phantom is causal one step removed; the fixed-filter corridor rerun is worth it on its merits - CHECK whether the ego then completes the pull-out. (c) HOST CONFOUND (gates the rebalance): atlas cold_v20_s1=633 phantoms+collided vs cetus rerun=45+completed. Either run-to-run non-determinism OR a HOST EFFECT (4080 vs 3080Ti produce different WF detections). If host effect, regions TOP(atlas)+BOTTOM(cetus) split reads machine as motion => rebalance breaks. TEST: 3 cetus fixed-seed reps (tmux hosttest, watcher bi33nowdc) + 3 atlas fixed-seed reps (BLOCKED: grid seed-major, cold_v20 run once; needs grid pause ~15min, peer's call). Preliminary: atlas phantom count varies WIDE across cells (v12=5,v16=25,v20=633,v24=44) => argues against a tight host offset. HELD: no regions restart, no corridor relaunch, no rebalance staging, until the host test reads out. Ghost fix committed 206192bc (location-keyed, carla_id=-1 scoped); conflicting_ticks fixed (bounded); collision_partner_resolved on corridor.
- CORRIDOR DECISION (peer, FINAL): NO rerun. Sequence (cold_r1): pull-out tick 365; truck SIDESWIPE tick 790 (ego at x=120.9 y=199.7 in the oncoming lane vs truck 195.4 => lateral clearance failure, ARM-INDEPENDENT, sets collided=YES); phantom STALL tick 1085 at x=103 (prevents completion). Removing the phantom would restore completion but the sideswipe stays (collided=yes, route_success=no on all arms), so the success column still would not separate => not worth 1.5 d cetus. Corridor STANDS on ownership-fencing (stale_owner=0 fenced, demonstrated to fire) + age-at-use continuity; safety result stays with the CLEAN headline. POST-DEADLINE LIMITATION (with the overlay merge, task #38 area): overtake lateral-clearance/sideswipe is a planner geometry defect, arm-independent, tick 790, ego y=199.7 vs truck y=195.4; fixing it touches the planner (restarts everything) so deferred. Phantom fix now matters for REGIONS only. cetus corridor tmux stays stopped; after the host test cetus is free for the (host-test-validated) rebalance. Host test is now the ONLY thing gating a restart decision, and only for regions.
- FREEZE-1N TRANSITION (peer, current): the ghost fix is adopted EVERYWHERE under a NEW TAG so one freeze = one code state. NEW TAG freeze-1n: EVAL_TAG=khonsu-eval-freeze-1n, measured CSVs frozen1n_* (peer verifier globs a char-range so it picks them up), output dirs frozen_1n_*. The only code delta from freeze-1m is the ghost fix (commit 206192bc). HOUSEKEEPING done (commit 9cb1ee9b): overlay dir renamed freeze_1m_overlay -> code_overlay (version-neutral; README states build=freeze-1n + the ghost-fix commit); apply.sh self-referential so rename-safe. Pre-fix frozen1m_* rows moved OUT of mock_data to ../quarantine_frozen1m_prefix (3 files) so no glob picks them up. Runners freeze-1n-tagged + committed 238b42bf; cetus runners pre-positioned.
- WHOLE-BLOCKS-PER-HOST (peer): never split a figure across machines. Regions BOTH panels on atlas; cetus takes whole blocks. A host offset then hits all arms in a block equally (preserves arm-to-arm), only loses cross-block absolute comparison (paper does not do it).
- HOST-EFFECT TEST (running): cetus 3 fixed-seed reps cold_v20_s1 = phantoms 47/26/45, ALL completed (episodes=0) -> tight, low, no collision. Atlas 3 reps running (bza3wsdk3, grid paused for it). Atlas has 1 grid sample (633, collided) + across-cell range 5-633. If atlas 3 reps are tight+high -> host effect (but whole-blocks makes it moot for scheduling); if wide -> non-determinism => success column needs MANY reps to average phantom noise (a reps remedy distinct from the filter fix, may need both). PEER caveat: comparable-in-distribution != comparable-per-cell.
- LIVE NOW: cetus tmux "capacity" = CAPACITY/BURST block freeze-1n (T8: burst 10x3 + q5 10xFLOW_N{2,4,8}x3 = 120), first-cell timing watcher bc5uxrgml to classify flow vs heavy. atlas = host-test 3 reps (bza3wsdk3), THEN regions RESTART on freeze-1n (fresh frozen_1n_t25, fixed edge) + new landloop + CONFIRM first frozen1n row before unattended. Corridor rerun queued behind capacity on cetus (freeze-1n, for RQ3/RQ4 columns only). Old landloop + pre-fix grid stopped.
- SCHEDULE (measured 294 runs/day/host): full 13-block campaign ~1372 runs; 1 host 4.7 d (~Sep 15), 2 hosts 2.3 d (~Sep 13, +20% reruns still ~Sep 13). Deadline Sep 17. TODO: cetus->atlas corridor landing bridge (lander outputs frozen1l_corridor_rows.csv, rename to frozen1m_, scp to atlas paper repo); realistic-driving profile for regions BOTTOM (slow lead + car-following, WaypointFollower avoid_collision, queue-tail 2.3, endogenous); 5 pending-runner blocks (T12 age, T14 overlap, T15 trigger-pareto, alternatives, T16-18 import-age/EdgeWarp) built off the critical path.

SEED FINDING (peer-raised, paper-wide; answered from code, HOLDING full sweep for the decision): the conflict scenario is FULLY DETERMINISTIC - oncoming spawned at FIXED transforms (ONCOMING_SHIFT_X is a deterministic constant offset, not a draw), fixed vehicle_velocities[i], geometric InTriggerDistanceToLocation trigger, traffic lights frozen green; scenario_1_1l.py has NO np.random/random. The seed hook (sim_api.py:638 np.random.seed(config['seed'])) defaults to random.seed(time.time()) and never reaches the conflict actors. So today "10/20 seeds" = repetitions of ONE scenario under CARLA synchronous-mode timing jitter = run-to-run spread, NOT independent scenario samples; the paper's "20 paired seeds, intervals as independent samples" overstates it. FIX (cheap, ~5 lines, recommended): read a per-run seed in scenario_1_1l.py, seed random.Random(seed), draw a small oncoming spawn-phase offset (spawn x +/- ~3 m or v0 +/- ~1 m/s) on top of ONCOMING_SHIFT_X, deterministic per seed-INDEX so it is PAIRED across arms (seed k = identical situation for warm/kf/cold). Then 20 seeds = 20 spawn-phase samples, intervals mean what the paper claims, applies to headline+corridor (same scenario_1 base). Awaiting peer/Tyler: add the paired spawn-phase seed, or relabel the paper as repetitions under timing jitter. This gates the whole campaign's interval semantics.

BEFORE the blocks that need them: add identity-settling HANDOFFROW columns (from the [MIG_IDENT] log via the lander) + identity-key the FDE/record-ablation/headline landers (key on tracklet identity, record resolved carla_id).

## 2026-09-09 (code session, latest): TWO migration-path DEFECTS found; Defect B fixed; WHOLE-CAMPAIGN rerun on freeze-1m ordered

Tyler's ruling: the delivery floor and the maturity gap are DEFECTS, not findings; fix-and-rerun. A migration-path defect invalidates every migrating arm's rows on 1k AND 1l, so the WHOLE campaign reruns on freeze-1m (headline, trigger, record ablation, loaded, T25, the new maneuvering sweep, T25b, non-central), both machines. This supersedes the freeze-1m gate-only plan below.

- DEFECT B (predictor maturity) - FIXED (scratchpad edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch + factories_1l, py_compile clean). Root cause: the predictor maturity gate reads len(ot.trajectory) (mtr_edge_predictor_1m:304); ot.trajectory is cleared+rebuilt each tick from the edge's LOCAL hist replay (_ab3d_history_to_trajs), so the imported memo_bank (the transferred record, factories:170) never counted -> MTR waited ~5 LOCAL frames (~80-tick gap) and re-accumulated its own history (this is why the FDE table clustered 42-46 m). Fix: after the local replay, for imported tracks (carry _migrated_vel_mps) rebuild ot.trajectory from the tracklet memo_bank in source-tick order (sorted by memo_tick, newest at index 0, capped at maxlen); [MIG_SEAM] logged once per import; factories stamps _n_imported. Produces the intended split: full record (warm/reactive/edgewarp, 10 frames) mature at the first destination cycle -> MTR on the migrated history; snapshot (kf/handover, 1 frame) CV until 5 local frames; ablation one_frame/hist2/hist5 mature after 4/3/0 local frames. Verified all import paths route through inject_latent_into_tracker + set _migrated_vel_mps (pluggable_base_wired:269-313), so the fix catches every arm.
- DEFECT A (delivery floor) - NOT yet fixed. commit->first_use = 13 ticks = 3.25 edge cycles for a PREPARED track; must be ~1 cycle (commit RPC applied in-cycle, publish in-cycle). Fix after B (B may cut it): add [MIG_COMMIT]/[MIG_APPLY]/[MIG_PUBLISH] markers, remove the cadence waits.
- ALSO built earlier this session (freeze-1m gate, option a): kinematic overtake gate (behavior_agent_1m: closed-form meeting from clear/speed/obs.gate_accel; a=0 -> old CV gate, byte-identical; MTR full-walk logged-only), edge gate_accel + gate_accel_src per tick, ONCOMING_SHIFT_X in scenario_1_1l (shifts only the oncoming). Prior gate v1 (walk MTR 5s forecast) was adverse (stop-biased, CV fallback) - REPLACED by option a.
- PROBE (constant-12) findings: crossing(shift) ~= 86 + 1.70*|shift|; delivery latency ~0.65 s floors usable T_avail; regimes delivered/floor/blind (blind = decision before first_use -> all arms collide). T_avail (peer def) = decision-arrival - crossing (arm-independent). These fed Tyler's defect ruling.
- PHASING (approved): (1) unit test = the paper's §4 round-trip (Mamba + KF: memo_bank byte-identity + first-forecast equality within float tol); (2) flow smoke @12 verifying B (destination MODESROW in the FIRST cycle after commit for warm; kf MTR after 5 local frames; [MIG_SEAM] clean); (3) Defect A markers + fix; (4) finer probe {+10,0,-10,-18,-26} x {12,cmd-2} x {warm,kf} dec-pinned; (5) mapping sign-off; (6) whole-campaign rerun on freeze-1m. NEXT = the unit test + the verify smoke.
- freeze-1m RERUN REQUIREMENTS accumulated this cycle (apply when building the rerun):
  - FDE block: re-land (the 42-46 m cluster was the maturity defect; warm/reactive should separate from the snapshot arms post-fix) + ADD a nohandoff reference arm = a single-locale config (openscenario_1_flow_nohandoff_gt.yaml: one locale spanning the oncoming path, BOTH RSUs in locale_0, no crossing/migration; config-only, runner fires no crossing). Log per run for the gating oncoming, ref + warm: num_agents/frame (edge:559), geometric n_rsu_covering/frame (RSU pos+range vs GT), memo_bank obs count at the anchor - so the reference's two-RSU coverage is attributed (upper bound, not "no handoff"), not silently credited. Landed frozen1m_fde_rows.csv = 6 arms + reference.
  - EdgeWarp: edgewarp_full (full record + predictive trigger) in EVERY block; route the visible-matrix (viscon) block through _mode_args too (freeze-1k viscon ran bare MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp = snapshot; that + the old density table go to the appendix with the mixed trigger+state caveat).
  - T_avail axis (peer def): decision-point arrival - crossing (arm-independent); launch-crossing = the arm-dependent annotation. Delivery floor ~0.65 s = a real region boundary (blind below it); panel x-axis 0.3-2.5 s includes the blind cliff.

## 2026-09-09 (code session): freeze-1l accel panel is FDE-only; closed-loop collision metric saturated

- Accel a=1..5 LANDED (frozen1l_acc_rows.csv, 250 rows, _acc_done Sep 9 05:04; a=0.5 still pending behind acc05 on the central lock). Levels are commanded a=2,3,4,5,6 (10 seeds x 5 arms warm/kf/reactive/cold/warm_ablation). Central chain now on its hln block; acc05 -> fde_subset -> noncentral queued behind it.
- est_a FIX HELD (the earlier lander bug is gone): warm/reactive estimate accel (est_a mean 6.23 at a>=4, matches GT actual_a ~6.3), kf/cold CV-only (est_a blank), warm_ablation blank (term off). Oncoming GT accel SATURATES ~6.3 m/s^2 (physical limit), so actual_a plateaus 6.25-6.6 for a>=3; at a=2 est_a@launch=0 because the oncoming has not begun accelerating at the launch tick (actual_a 3.89 develops after).
- COLLISION METRIC SATURATED: 0 collisions across ALL 250 runs, every arm, every level (collided=no, completed=YES for all 250). The constant-accel-from-spawn scenario (unlike the freeze-1k ego-triggered step, which was 0/10 completion) now COMPLETES in every arm but SEPARATES none on collisions. NOTE: an earlier pandas pass mis-coerced the string columns (completed=YES->NaN) and read 0/250 completed; the correct read is 250/250 completed, 0/250 collided.
- MECHANISM: the scenario DOES create genuine conflicts. The accelerating oncoming reaches the ego lane during the overtake commit ([TRAJ_COLL] collision=True ttc=0.10 spatial_min=0.0m at a=6), and the ego's collision-checker + emergency brake is a HARD BACKSTOP that prevents the physical collision in every arm (minTTC~0, maxjerk saturated at 100 for all arms). The forecast-quality difference (warm accel term vs kf CV) is absorbed by the braking backstop, not converted into a collision difference.
- NO closed-loop metric separates warm from kf: minTTC ~0 all arms; collTrue/run and ghost_brakes are NOISY and where they differ warm is MORE conservative, not safer (a=2 warm ghost_br 24.8 > kf 17.2; a=6 warm 33.2 > kf 22.7). The accel term makes the planner brake MORE (its forecast puts the oncoming closer), it does not make kf collide.
- CONSEQUENCE: the accel/maneuvering panel is FORECAST-QUALITY (FDE) ONLY, consistent with the record-depth ablation finding below (FDE monotone, not closed-loop safety). warm's accel term reduces FDE at high accel (captures ~6.3 m/s^2 that kf ignores -> ~0.5*6.3*1^2 ~= 3 m position error over the 1 s lookahead at a=6); the FDE subset (frozen1l_fde_rows.csv, still running in the chain) will quantify it directly. The load-bearing CLOSED-LOOP safety separation remains cold-vs-migrated in the FLOW scenario ONLY (freeze-1k: cold 9/20 collisions, warm 6/195, kf 0/20; kf is safe in flow because flow has no acceleration).
- Tyler P0 (khonsu must work with acceleration) is satisfied at the FORECAST level (the accel term works: est_a tracks GT accel). It is NOT demonstrated at the closed-loop-safety level (no accel scenario shows warm collides less than kf). REPORTED to peer for the accel-panel framing call: (a) accel panel = FDE-vs-accel, honest, recommended; (b) tighten the conflict window so the backstop cannot save kf (scenario redesign + full rerun, real cost). Freshness separating level (collision-based warm>=8 AND kf<=3) is UNDEFINED (no arm collides) -> fallback 3.

- T25 SPEED SWEEP re-run LANDED (frozen1k_t25_rows.csv, 200 rows, machine cetus; 4 arms warm/kf/reactive/cold x 5 oncoming speeds v8,12,16,20,24 x 10 seeds; the clobber-bug rerun with per-run ONCOMING_SPEED). Result reinforces the same closed-loop story: the separation is COLD-vs-MIGRATED, strongest at LOW oncoming speed. Collisions/10: v8 cold 10, warm 2, kf 0, reactive 0; v12 cold 10, reactive 1, warm 0, kf 0; v16/v20/v24 all arms 0. At low oncoming speed the ego attempts the overtake and cold (blind, no migrated forecast of the occluded oncoming) mistimes it; as oncoming speed rises the conflict window shrinks and the ego waits in every arm (no overtake attempt -> no collision). warm-vs-kf does NOT separate on collisions (kf safe at every speed; constant-velocity is correct when the oncoming holds speed), same as flow and accel.
- The ONLY warm-vs-kf edge in T25 is UTILITY not safety: at v24 warm completes 10/10 overtakes, kf completes 7/10 (3 time out waiting, 0 collisions) - warm's forecast lets it commit to overtakes kf is too uncertain to attempt. Within ten-seed noise (3/10); flagged to peer as a candidate utility signal, not a claim.
- CONSOLIDATED across flow + accel + T25: the load-bearing CLOSED-LOOP collision separation is cold-start-vs-migrated (migration eliminates the blind-overtake collision). Fresh-vs-stale (warm vs kf) does NOT appear in closed-loop collisions in any scenario measured; it lives in FDE (forecast quality) and, weakly, in overtake-completion utility at the high-speed tail. This is the honest safety story for the paper.

## 2026-09-09 (code session, later): peer metric correction (timeout=failure); full outcome tables; accel needs (b) redesign

- Peer (95) corrected the metric: Tyler's rule is completed-without-collision; a TIMEOUT or unfinished route is a FAILURE, not neutral. My earlier "v24 kf is a utility footnote" was wrong: on the paper's metric it is a separation. Produced the three requested tables from the landed rows + log parsing (scratchpad/peer_tables.py). completed = distance_traveled_m >= COMPLETE_DIST_M (90 m), a distance threshold in khonsu_design_extract.py:60 (a pure wait fails it, so waits are NOT counted as success).
- TABLE 1 (T25, success = completed AND not collided, n=10): cold v8/v12 = 0 success (10 collide each), v16/20/24 = 10; reactive 10/9/10/10/10; warm 8/10/10/10/10 (v8: 2 collisions); kf 10/10/10/10/7 (v24: 3 TIMEOUTS that never launched the overtake). never-launched = 0 everywhere EXCEPT kf v24 = 3 (== the 3 timeouts), so high-speed success for cold/reactive/warm is a real launched pass, not a wait. TOTALS/50: reactive 49, warm 48, kf 47, cold 30. warm-vs-kf = 1 run = NOISE; the separation is cold-vs-migrated + a weak kf-v24 tail. T25 does NOT separate warm from kf on the metric.
- TABLE 2 (accel mechanism, n=10): ALL arms 10/10 success at every level (0 collisions, 0 timeouts). Mechanism the peer hypothesized (kf launches into the closing gap, backstop saves, aborts, relaunches later) is ABSENT: aborts ~0 (recheck ABORT 0-0.1/run), holds 0, recommits ~0; backstop firings (collision=True ttc<0.5) fire 15-43/run for ALL arms with no clean warm-vs-kf order; completion time (time_alive_s) kf 18.7 vs warm 18.1 pooled = within noise, per-level non-monotone. The ONE trace: warm launches ~15 ticks (~0.75 s) EARLIER than kf at a>=4 (warm ~176, kf ~192), consistent with the accel-aware forecast giving earlier commit confidence, but it does not convert to an outcome (both 10/10). A completion-time window would NOT separate them on the current scenario.
- TABLE 3 (GT accel per commanded level, pooled): a=2 -> 3.89 m/s^2 (speed@crossing 20.0); a=3 -> 6.37; a=4 -> 6.25; a=5 -> 6.36; a=6 -> 6.28 (speed@crossing plateaus ~22.8). The oncoming SATURATES the speed cap, so the 5 commanded levels are really TWO physical levels (3.9 and 6.3). The accel "sweep" is degenerate: 4 of 5 points are the same acceleration.
- CONCLUSION (agrees with peer): the accel maneuvering panel is triply degenerate for a closed-loop warm-vs-kf claim (collision saturated + mechanism absent + only 2 real accel levels). Direction (b): redesign so (i) the accel spans real levels without the plateau (raise the oncoming speed cap / use accels that do not saturate, add lower levels) and (ii) the conflict timing is tight enough that kf's constant-velocity mistiming costs the run (collision or timeout) within a completion window applied EQUALLY to every arm, then rerun the block whole. (a) FDE-only is not sufficient for the maneuvering panel because the paper's claim is closed-loop. Nothing changed yet; reported to peer, awaiting the go to build+smoke the redesigned scenario.

## 2026-09-09 (code session): ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED - the overtake gate is forecast-horizon-blind

- Peer (95) hypothesized and I CONFIRMED from code: the scenario is NOT the first problem; the overtake go/no-go never consumes the forecast horizon, so warm=kf at the decision by construction. The maneuvering panel cannot separate fresh-vs-stale until the planner (the consumer under test) is changed.
- EVIDENCE (behavior_agent_1k.py): the go/no-go is _nearest_oncoming_ahead (:1092-1168) = distance from traj[0].location (the oncoming's CURRENT position, :1123) and closing speed obs.kf_speed_mps (the tracker's CURRENT ground speed, :1140, explicitly NOT a finite-difference of the predicted trajectory :1135-1139). The forecast horizon (traj[1]) is read only for DIRECTION (:1151-1156), never arrival. Consumers: initial gate :2263-2272 (GO iff clear >= need, need = 4.0*(7.0+kf_speed_mps)); per-tick recheck :1765-1766; recommit-after-abort :1813-1815. All current-speed sight distance. The docstring claim that migration "recovers the accelerating speed and widens the need" is only the current-speed SCALAR (a stale snapshot vs a fresh track), NOT the acceleration TREND; empirically (Table 2) even that current-speed freshness does not flip the gate.
- The top-2-modes forecast IS consumed, but only by trajectory_collision_check (:845 order[:top_k], :855-879) = the [TRAJ_COLL] backstop / emergency brake (crossing-conflict path), NOT the overtake go/no-go. That is why warm fires the backstop MORE (accel-aware forecast predicts the oncoming closer) yet the OUTCOME equals kf: the forecast reaches the brake, not the decision.
- MINIMAL FIX (peer-specified, ~1 function + 3 call sites, NOT built): in _nearest_oncoming_ahead compute the oncoming's time-to-reach-the-pass-zone from the DELIVERED forecast trajectory (first sample entering the ego overtake corridor, interpolated via the trajectory dt), return arrival_time; go/no-go compares maneuver_time (4 s) vs arrival_time; FALLBACK to distance/kf_speed_mps when no forecast (cold) or horizon too short. Recheck + recommit use the same arrival; backstop unchanged; SAME code every arm. Build detail to confirm: predicted_trajectory per-sample time parameterization and horizon length. This makes warm's accel-aware curve give an earlier arrival (WAIT) and kf's CV line a later arrival (GO into the closing gap) -> the separation.
- RERUN SCOPE (this changes the PLANNER = one-tag-per-table forces rerun of any table sharing a tag with the maneuvering panel; Tyler decides): at CONSTANT speed trajectory-arrival == distance/current-speed within forecast error, so headline/T25/hln should NOT move in expectation, but must be reverified. Hours: accel (5x5x10=250) ~11 h/1GPU ~6 h/2GPU; T25 (4x5x10=200) ~9 h/1GPU ~5 h/2GPU (regions figure holds both -> both one tag); hln loaded (6x5=30) ~2-2.5 h; full central (if headline/B/F must move) ~13-14 h + cetus tail ~7-8 h. Recommend minimum single-tag: accel + T25 rerun on freeze-1m; headline/B/F/hln stay on 1k/1l unless a table merges them with the maneuvering panel.
- Accel levels for the redesign (peer-decided): commanded 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 (GT ~2.5-4.5 then 6.3 at the vehicle limit), keep trigger distance until the gate consumes the forecast then set from the smoke. STATUS: not building; awaiting Tyler's rerun-scope call. When cleared, build the gate change + redesigned scenario together and smoke both before any full rerun.

## 2026-09-07 (code session, later): fair-KF smoke passes fix, gate exposes inv8 planner-provenance mismatch; freeze-1k BLOCKED

- freeze-1k fair-KF fix CONFIRMED by smoke (idfix_wt/evaluation_outputs/smoke_1k, 18/18 cells, dbl_ticks=0 everywhere): snapshot exports now carry velocity via the last-3-frames estimator. kf coast |v|=10.92 constant (was 8.39 pre-fix; 12 truth). Snapshot arms now largely COMPLETE at flow-default (kf 2/3, handover 3/3, edgewarp 2/3, one_frame 3/3, warm 3/3, hist5 2/3). The easy operating point no longer separates warm from the fair KF; separation must come from the T_obs ladder (T25 speed, band, density). CVMIGRATED dormant (cvmig=0) at 12 m/s as designed.
- ACCEPTANCE GATE FAILS on the 1k smoke, two invariants:
  - inv7 (coast band) FAIL on edgewarp_s1 ONLY: coast |v|=6.86 CONSTANT whole run (43% low), s2/s3=11.60. Fair-KF estimator instability that seed: last-3-frames span divides by _stride_ema, which inflates on a laggy publish cadence (edgewarp does the most per-tick work). Caused edgewarp_s1's collision.
  - inv8 (planner recheck) FAIL on ALL 18 cells (recheck=0, do_ov=True>0). ROOT CAUSE: [OT RECHECK] exists in NO idfix_wt file and NO 1k overlay file. The gate was validated on merged_smoke_flowburst, which used behavior_agent_MERGED.py (the 1i planner with the per-tick recheck block, merged lines 1797-1846, recheck=175-204). The freeze-1j AND 1k campaigns use behavior_agent_1H.py, which LACKS that block (no `if self.do_overtake:` recheck; _nearest_oncoming_ahead called only once at commit). So the gate never validated the 1h planner; inv8 is unsatisfiable for any 1h-based smoke. freeze-1j was gated against a different planner (merged/1i) than the data it shipped (1h).
- This ties to the earlier 1i-quarantine narrative below: the per-tick recheck's ABORT-to-lane branch was the 1i bug (drives ego off road / reverses). 1j reverted the WHOLE block, dropping both the abort bug AND the safety HOLD (recheck -> proper-response brake when an opposing track enters clearance after commit). So merged = recheck + abort bug; 1h = no abort bug + no recheck. The 1k smoke collisions concentrate in the marginal-velocity arms (kf 2/3, edgewarp 2/3, hist5 2/3) with warm 3/3 clean, consistent with the missing recheck: kf_s2 collided (episodes=3) with a GOOD velocity (10.92, passes inv7) and hazard_flag=True.
- BLOCKED on peer decision (reported): A) port recheck-as-HOLD-only into 1h (no abort branch) + re-smoke + re-run whole; B) keep 1h, make inv8 planner-aware (NA when recheck absent), accept the gap; C) fix the abort bug inside merged, keep its recheck, re-run whole. Recommended A or C, not B. NOT tagged. Gate 'k_' prefix + fair-KF pluggable_base fix staged, uncommitted pending the decision.
- Also this session (develop, pushed): khonsu_shape_check tag-to-tag regression rule (flags q5_n8_warm freeze-1g:5/5->1j:2/5); skip untagged design_sweep_v3 in load_rows; README marks cetus hln20 block INVALID (forced-N override, freshness-cliff-near-300ms observation recorded) and Table 8 HELD (not identity-merge: dbl_ticks=0, multi-tid uncorrelated with outcome -> planner/seed noise at n=5; 10-seed rerun protocol recorded). burst 5/5 premise corrected: no tagged 1g 5/5 (freeze-1g burst_warm is 0/5; the 5/5 was untagged design_sweep_v3).

## 2026-09-07 (code session, path C decided + built): planner recheck + exact-tick estimator
- Peer chose path C with A's scoping. Campaign planner = behavior_agent_1k = 1h + per-tick overtake recheck with a SAFE response: clear<need and subj_ahead<0 -> COMPLETE (continue pass); subj_ahead>=following_gap(7m) -> ABORT = safe return BEHIND the subject (collision-checked return path); 0<=subj_ahead<7 (alongside) -> force proper-response brake + HOLD, never steer back; timer frozen during HOLD; 10-tick recommit hold. Curved guard + Jordan TTC left out as in 1h. Diff: behavior_agent_1k.py 1742-1748 (timer guard), 1754-1821 (recheck), 2314-2325 (return-behind trigger). VALIDATED: accel warm 3/3 clean (original abort-to-lane failure fixed), gate inv8 PASS all cells (recheck runs, zero unsafe aborts).
- Gate inv8 rewritten for the new planner: recheck>0 AND no ABORT at subj_ahead<7 (unsafe return); HOLD/brake no longer penalized; accel_warm now BLOCKING (was DEFER). khonsu_accept.py on develop working tree (uncommitted, goes with the tag).
- ESTIMATOR (the hard part). The exported migrated velocity was wrong because the tracker feed cadence is RUNTIME-VARIABLE: the frame index passed to tracker.track() is source_tick, frames are drained from a jitter buffer, so inter-frame gaps are 1/2/4 sim ticks within AND across otherwise-identical runs. Ruled out empirically: EMA (edgewarp 6.86), median (flow 24.13), configured edge_dt=0.2 (flow 3.0) all mis-scale by ~2-4x. FIX (peer-approved, exact per-frame ticks): wrapper exposes _src_tick; tracker plumbs it to all 4 tracklet call sites (update/re_activate/activate); tracklet stamps memo_tick parallel to memo_bank (lockstep truncation); factories+payload carry memo_tick (int32, +~34B/transfer, measured); pluggable_base spans exported velocity on (tick[-1]-tick[-n])*sim_tick_s. Result: coast |v| 11.6 uniform (within 5% of 12), inv7 passes.
- PITFALL: also tried setting _spf_live (coast PROJECTION dt) to the exact last gap. WRONG: the last gap flips 0.1<->0.2 tick-to-tick and the projection re-anchors as vel*spf*steps (uniform-spf), so a flipping spf JITTERS the coast and warm_s1 collided (do_ov 129 vs ~44). Reverted _spf_live to the stable EMA; warm back to 3/3 clean. The exported velocity uses exact ticks (one-shot); the projection keeps the smooth EMA. frozen_1k proved correct-velocity+EMA-projection = warm clean, so the collision was the jitter, not the corrected velocity.
- 10-file overlay (scratchpad *_wired + behavior_agent_1k + edge_manager_merged): behavior_agent, EM, pluggable_base, runner, mtr, wrapper, tracker, tracklet, factories, payload.
- GATE RESULT (cand2_1k, 19 cells): all 9 protocol invariants PASS on all cells. Core arms clean: warm/kf/edgewarp/handover/one_frame 3/3, t12bo 1/1, coast |v| 10.9-11.6 (within 5% of 12), inv8 zero unsafe aborts. warm bytes 5056 vs 4816 pre-tick (+~34B/transfer = the K-tick int32 field). ONLY failure: accel_warm_complete 2/3 (the 3/3 check I made blocking). accel_warm_s3 collided via a SAFE abort (subj_ahead=20, unsafe_abort=0) then stopped behind the truck -> NOT the abort-to-lane bug (fixed; inv8 confirms), it is accel-hardness (accelerating oncoming outpaces the last-3-frames velocity). Reported to peer: recommend relaxing accel_warm to non-blocking (inv8 already validates the fix) and tagging on the clean protocol pass; awaiting the criterion call.
- TAG MESSAGE CORRECTION: the peer's drafted message says "coast projection uses exact frame timing" but _spf_live was reverted to the smoothed EMA (the exact per-frame gap jittered the projection and collided warm_s1). Accurate message: velocity spans exact per-frame source ticks carried in the record; coast projection uses the smoothed cadence. To finalize with peer before tagging.
- DONE: accel relaxed to non-blocking (gate ALL PASS). TAGGED khonsu-eval-freeze-1k = bc26cd3e (fix_wt / fix-oncoming-gate, pushed; 9 files, runner byte-identical to 1j so unchanged). develop gate + README accel/estimator note pushed (57d004f0). Peer has the hash + smoke tables.
- 1k Atlas campaign LAUNCHED (frozen_batch_1k_campaign.sh, task b89zscwtg, ~21h): A1-10, B1-10, E, F1-10 (fb_edgewarpsnap=MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp), ACC1-10 (accel maneuvering panel, edgewarp=edgewarp_full), T25 speed, A11-20, B11-20. Block A/ACC edgewarp = edgewarp_full. Lands to frozen1k_rows.csv per block. Band/load/loaded/freshness -> 1l. Faults NOT included (needs FAULT_MODE / T7, flagged to peer). Extractor label remap (edgewarp_full->"edgewarp", edgewarp->"edgewarp_snap") to apply at figure time.
- RE-SPLIT (peer): Atlas 1k = A1-10 -> B1-10 -> F1-10 -> E -> A11-20 -> B11-20 (paper-priority order; ACC + T25 moved to cetus), per-cell CARLA restart, resumable (skips cells with a RUNROW). Relaunched task by132iq28, ~13.7h (305 cells). 1l smoke slot goes after block B when 1l is ready. Script: scratchpad/frozen_batch_1k_campaign.sh (frozen_1k_camp output dir).
- Tag hashes: khonsu-eval-freeze-1k = annotated-tag-object bc26cd3e -> commit 4d94d420. Checkout by NAME.
- Cetus (tlandle@143.215.184.49): VALIDATED + RUNNING 1k (cetus_1k_batch.sh: ACC1-10 -> T25; lands frozen1k_cetus_rows.csv). First ACC cell clean: transfers=2, coast |v|=11.85, HANDOFF=1, Unpickle=0, EVAL=885. Bringup needed 3 env-drift fixes (env-compat only; tag code untouched; Atlas unaffected because Atlas runs older torch): (1) stopped stale cetus_1j_tail.sh via a NAMED remote script -- inline `pkill -f cetus_1j_tail.sh` self-matched the ssh shell and killed itself; scp a kill script instead. (2) cetus PyTorch 2.6 defaults torch.load weights_only=True -> rejects MTR + Mamba checkpoints; fix = sitecustomize shim on PYTHONPATH + `sed weights_only=False` on the MTR load (mtr_edge_predictor.py:249). (3) `git checkout -f <tag>` resets LFS-tracked model checkpoints to 134-byte pointers (cetus has NO git-lfs smudge) -> "invalid load key, 'v'"; fix = cache the real files from Atlas (best_model.pth 624MB, mamba3dmot_weights.pth 53MB) in /tmp/cetus_models and the batch restores them AFTER checkout, size-guarded. WF caronly_aug_thresh02/net_epoch39.pth is UNTRACKED so it survived. Scripts: cetus_1k_batch.sh, cetus_killall.sh (thorough kill + rm /tmp/cetus_1k.lock), cetus_stop_clean.sh. Cetus TAIL (Table8@10/matrix/netem/bisect) = cetus_1k_tail.sh, build after ACC+T25.
- BOTH 1k campaigns running + validated: Atlas (relaunched bljpfn50k after a resumable restart to re-run hl_handoversnap_r7; ~13.7h), cetus (~7h for ACC+T25).
- Block A (A1-10) landed: warm 10/10, edgewarp_full 10/10, kf 10/10, reactive 9/10, handover 9/9 valid (+r7 re-run in progress -> /10), cold 4/10 (4 completed / 4 collided / 2 safe-abort-timeout r4,r6: do_ov~3, brake to stop behind truck x~293, timeout tick 1095 -> measured mechanism, in the paper).
- CETUS ENV VALIDATED via flow-at-12 (peer's gate for every cetus block): cetus t25_warm/reactive/kf @v12 = 5/5/5 clean, cold 0/5 (expected); matches Atlas hl_warm 20/20. No timing divergence.
- ACC (accel maneuvering) is a WIPEOUT 0/10 for EVERY arm (warm/kf/edgewarp_full/reactive/cold; handover 1/10). NOT a cetus artifact (env validated, models md5-identical, runs valid). ROOT CAUSE (scenario_1.py ~131): ONCOMING_ACCEL is a BOOLEAN that runs a two-phase STEP, not a constant accel - oncoming cruises 5 m/s then floors to 16 m/s the moment the EGO is within 30 m of the conflict. Confirmed on ac_warm_r1: at launch (do_ov tick 130) oncoming is ~5 m/s; step fires AFTER launch (8.6@152, 16@196), min TTC 0.19. So the step is EGO-TRIGGERED and exogenous to the oncoming's history -> no history-based arm (warm included) can predict it -> all fail, no differentiation. Reported to peer: for a differentiating maneuvering panel the accel must be CONSTANT-FROM-SPAWN (in the history so warm captures the trend, snapshot misses it); the ego-triggered step is the exogenous-limit point. Peer reframed ACC as an acceleration-MAGNITUDE axis. Step 3 (accel sweep on cetus after T25, warm/kf/reactive/cold x5 x ~4 magnitudes, frozen1k_cetus_acc_rows.csv with oncoming_accel col) needs scenario_1.py parameterized to constant-accel float -> 1l or a documented freeze-1k scenario patch. HELD for peer steer (option a: constant-from-spawn sweep; option b: report 0/10 as the exogenous-step limit). T25-done watch bcifmealf armed.
- ID CORRECTION (supersedes prior summary): CID 201 is a MOVING ONCOMING car (GT x 156->339), NOT the truck. The stationary firetruck (overtake subject, x=278) is a different actor (~198). Earlier flow/F reports that treated 201 as the truck (gating=200, "live by launch") were WRONG.
- FLOW headline+F mechanism, DEFINITIVE (diag committed 14e34b6e; frozen1k_headline_diag.csv + frozen1k_ablation_diag.csv; sustained-launch = first run of >=4 consecutive do_ov=True; collision_partner_resolved = nearest non-ego actor at collision): MIGRATION ELIMINATES ONCOMING COLLISIONS. cold 9/20 collided = 6 head-ons with oncoming 201 (blind, never migrated; detectable at 132 but never delivered) + 3 truck(198) rear-ends; reactive 2/20 = BOTH truck rear-ends (longitudinal creep, r14 too-late overtake); warm/kf/edgewarp/handover 0. first_use is DEPTH-INDEPENDENT (dest commit identically 255 for one_frame and hist5 all 10 seeds; first_use lag seed-driven not depth) -> peer's "depth->earlier first_use->hold-vs-blind" hypothesis REFUTED; the r1 273-vs-267 was seed noise. Shared first decision (truck arrival/hold) constant ~195 across arms; overtake launch varies by oncoming availability. hist5 holds behind truck 267->390, launches after 201 passes (informed hold). PAPER: record-depth ablation is FORECAST-QUALITY only (FDE 69/61.8/40.7 monotone), NOT closed-loop safety at flow@12; load-bearing closed-loop separation = cold-vs-migrated (oncoming collisions) + the maneuvering panel. §5.2 held by peer for these final rows.
- DEGENERATE-RUN HANDLING (peer-requested, committed 02f9b299): a CARLA startup transient ("is not found in your CARLA repo" / "has no attribute 'world'" -> no actors, no EGO-DBG) writes a RUNROW but never ran. Lander (khonsu_design_extract.py) now EXCLUDES such logs as INVALID (not a not-completed failure); campaign run() retries such a cell once and the skip-if-done guard refuses to skip a degenerate log so a restart re-runs it. First instance: Block A hl_handoversnap_r7 (quarantined .INVALID_town01, re-running). Only 1 of 65 Block A cells hit it.
- Diag extractors refined (peer): khonsu_ablation_diag.py adds vel_est_first_coast alongside closest-to-launch; khonsu_multicross_diag.py adds dbl_ticks + pathology=YES on any concurrent-dup OR dbl_ticks>0, and stale_consumed=not_scoreable when no stale/epoch markers. Run extractor 1 on F when it lands, extractor 2 on Table 8; report the two reading-rule verdicts. Selector gated on the capacity verdict.
- Faults: NOT 1k (peer). FAULT_MODE arms are 1l code, after repl_final + kf_final; live-fault table lands under 1l.
- freeze-1l build (next, no GPU for code): T12 override fix -> repl_final (PRIORITY, replication baseline in the alternatives figure) -> kf_final -> ONCOMING_SHIFT_X+shift_x_m -> logging fields (prepare_arrival_tick, ready_tick, first_usable_forecast_tick; per-crossing first_detection_tick, tenth_observation_tick, first_prediction_tick; association actual separation) -> FAULT_MODE arms. 1l smoke = 1 cell/mode+knob + warm x1, gated. Extractor label remap for 1k figures: edgewarp_full->"edgewarp", edgewarp->"edgewarp_snap".

## 2026-09-07 (writing session, 00:00-01:00): freeze-1i QUARANTINED, planner regression, freeze-1j ordered

- Tyler asked "how's evals" then "fix it". 1i status at midnight: Atlas block A 49/60 (no-contact runs warm 7/9, reactive 6/8, cold 3/8, edgewarp 3/8, snapshot 1/8, kf 0/8); cetus T12 bo 35/35, N=28 5/5, Table 8 starting.
- ANOMALY: T12 bo on 1i is non-monotone in load: no-contact runs N=4 3/5, 8 1/5, 12-20 0/5, 24 5/5, 31 2/5 while AGEROW p95 is 600 ms flat through N=20, 800 at 24, 1200 at 31 (same age axis as 1f, which was clean 5/5 through N=20). Not an age effect. Eval-session extractor (authoritative): every run launched the overtake; every collided run has [OT RECHECK] ABORT=1 and its contact actor is carla_id 201, the stationary carlacola truck occluder (oncoming 200 only at N=31 under real load); every clean run at N<=20 and all five N=24 runs have ABORT=0. My earlier read that N=24 never launched was a sampling artifact of the EGO-DBG trace. 1f and 1i T12 are the same design (mode=warm, predictive, lookahead 1.00, band 20, migration on): design unchanged, code changed.
- ROOT CAUSE (from hl_warm_r1, hl_cold_r1, hl_warm_r2 traces): the per-tick [OT RECHECK] ABORT path added to behavior_agent between 1h and 1i (our accel fix: recheck every tick, abort-to-lane if the subject is still ahead, 10-tick re-commit hold). ABORT fires mid-launch (need = 4(7+v_onc) = 76 m at 12 m/s vs clear 21 m); the return-to-lane path then drives the ego off the road (warm_r1: y=187.9, v=0, stuck t=450-700, contact_ticks=30) or turns it around (cold_r1: x increases 281 -> 321 at 11.6 m/s heading east, "COMPLETE subj_ahead=-20" only because the ego reversed). Clean runs have no ABORT. Jordan's separate TTC is a no-op in flow (2.0 s = collision_time_ahead 2); the curved-road guard removal and the opposing-track lateral lift change launch timing in unquantified ways.
- DECISION (fix-and-rerun): freeze-1i results quarantined (logs kept, no CSV to docs/kb/data). freeze-1j = 1i with behavior_agent.py reverted byte-for-byte to freeze-1h; every protocol-side 1i change kept (identity merge, projection, replace-on-inject, publish gate, factorial wiring, MIGRATION_HIST, edgewarp_full). Smoke: blind overtake warm look1 3/3 completed + contact-free with 1g-like launch, cold x3 with the 1g creep signature, T12 bo N=20 warm 3/3, burst warm 1; acceptance gate; tag; relaunch both chains with the same order and landers. Planner work (recheck/abort, lateral lift, Jordan's TTC, curved-road removal) returns with the accel scenario in a later tag, tested on accel only.
- 1j SMOKE (00:40): planner revert verified (behavior_agent diff vs 1h = 0; the only 1i->1j change). bo warm N=4 3/3 clean (launch x~298 v~2.6), bo cold N=4 3/3 collide (ordering visible), burst warm clean, OT RECHECK count 0 everywhere, no off-road, no reversal: the 1i abort defect is fixed. BUT T12 bo warm N=20 3/3 collide with the truck (launch x~302 v~1.8), where 1f was 5/5 clean. 1f and 1h behavior_agent are byte-identical and the 1h->1i protocol delta is inert for warm flow, so this is a 1f->1h change in the migration/prediction path (candidates: 1g publish gate; 1h identity merge / projection / replace-on-inject; worldfusion EM +73, tracklet.py +23, daemon +6, factories +7, runner +11). DECISION: tag 1j and relaunch the full Atlas chain (block A first, default N where warm is clean); cetus bisects by tag first: T12 bo warm N=20 seeds 1-3 on 1f, 1g, 1h (~50 min). Rule: 1f clean + 1g collides = publish gate = §3.4 behavior, 1f's clean N=20 was the pre-commit leak, sweep proceeds on 1j and the cliff is reported where it lands; 1g clean + 1h collides = regression, hold T12, fix on 1j+1; 1f collides now = seed/load luck, sweep proceeds. Also: T12 bo runs (1f and 1i) are mode=warm WITH migration (transfers > 0), contrary to the "no migration in play" wording in paper §5.4 and the deck notes; correcting both once confirmed from the 1f rows.
- REVISED (00:50, eval-session analysis accepted): the 1f->1h behavioral changes on the flow path are (1) the coast projection anchor in mamba3dmot/tracklet.py (1f accumulated from the running predicted box; 1h projects from the last observed box by mig_vel x steps, the deliberate cb9888f4 coast fix with [COASTROW]), age-dependent by construction, and (2) the EM publish gate + duplicate carla_id merge. Either way the 1j behavior is the paper's protocol and 1f's clean N=20 was not a more correct forecast. Decision (A): tag freeze-1j, relaunch everything (Atlas A first, cetus T12 bo first), report the cliff where it lands on 1j. The 9-run tag bisect (1f/1g/1h at N=20 x3) is appended to the end of the cetus tail as the explanation for the paper, not a gate on tonight's runs.
- FREEZE-1j TAGGED = khonsu-eval-freeze-1j -> 9ca76adf (code-only, pushed; behavior_agent byte-identical to 1h, the only change vs the 1i tag; kept: identity merge, projection, publish gate, MIGRATION_HIST, edgewarp_full, EVAL horizons). LAUNCHED ~01:00: Atlas A 1-10 -> B -> E -> F -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20 (overlay); cetus on 9ca76adf: bo T12 sweep -> N=28 -> Table 8, tail: matrix -> T19b -> 9-run bisect (1f/1g/1h at N=20). ETAs: block A ~2.5-3 h (~2.5 min/run), T12 bo ~1.5-2 h. Config sign-off rows received (A: 6 arms lut_n=scene; B: look2/3/4, computed, mtr theta 0.5, oracle; E: theta {0.3,0.4,0.6,0.7,0.9}; F: one_frame/hist2/hist5 = MIGRATION_HIST 1/2/5, edgewarp_full, band20/40; cetus as listed). CONFIRMED: T12 bo runs are warm WITH migration (1f t12_bo_n20_s1 transfers=7); paper §5.4 and deck note corrected (handoff active on the forecast trigger; source stream before the crossing, destination after). Block A load: lut_n=scene (live count: 8 oncoming + ego + truck), realized age ~100 ms, network age ~22 ms at the decision; the paper states the headline runs at the scenario's native load. Source-vs-destination stream per T12 decision is derivable post hoc from HANDOFFROW first_use_tick vs decision tick plus AGEROW; no retag.
- BLOCK A on freeze-1j LANDED (05:41, frozen1j_rows.csv, 60 rows, eval_tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1j, lut_n=scene): success/10 warm (1 s + final update) 9, reactive 10, handover snapshot 1, kf 0, edgewarp 0, cold 0. Shape check AGREE. Paper Table 5 regenerated (`make_floats.py --tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1j`; the tag column carries the full tag name, `--tag freeze-1j` matches 0 rows); §5.3 prose, abstract, intro, conclusion counts updated (history methods 9 to 10 of 10, snapshot methods 0 to 1). Trigger table (gen_tab_trigger.tex) and lead CDF restored to the 1g versions until 1j block B lands (make_floats regenerates every float from the newest tag, so partial landings overwrite tables that have not re-landed: restore from git after each run). Deck headline slide on 1j (real_headline.png via slides/make_headline_png.py; columns tag/mode/collided YES/completed YES), pushed to gtvault (verify_v18). Contact actors on 1j (eval session): NOT uniformly the truck (that was the 1i abort artifact). warm 1/10 -> oncoming 200; kf 10/10 -> truck x2, oncoming x1, unpredicted x7; edgewarp 10/10 -> truck x4, oncoming x2, unpredicted x4; handover_snapshot 9/10 -> truck x1, oncoming x3, unpredicted x5; cold 10/10 -> truck x1, oncoming x3, unpredicted x6. "unpredicted" = collided with no [PRED COLLISION] warning: no edge forecast of the occluded oncoming, the overtake launches blind (2-4 m/s; oncoming 11-12 m/s at contact). Paper §5.3 mechanism paragraph rewritten accordingly (the 1g "every collision is the truck" statement is withdrawn for 1j); deck bullet and notes updated. Bytes per run on 1j: warm 4816-5432, reactive 2488, edgewarp 1632-1904, kf 816-1088, handover_snapshot 816-976, cold 0-160. frozen1j_rows.csv committed d23f07e3 (force-added, *.csv is gitignored in that dir by convention).
- BLOCK B on freeze-1j LANDED (09:17, frozen1j_rows.csv now 120 rows): success/10 fixed 1 s 9 (hl_warm), 2 s 10, 3 s 9, 4 s 9, computed 8, mtr (design arm) 10, oracle 7; bytes 4.7-5.4 KB per run in every trigger arm. Shape check lead AGREE (1s 9, 2s 10, 3s 9, 4s 9). The 4 s collapse of 1g (5/10, extrapolated track past the 8 m gate -> duplicate) is gone with the identity merge. Oracle 7/10 is within ten-seed noise, no mechanism claimed. Paper Table 6 regenerated on 1j; §5.5 gets a results paragraph (mechanism stated, no tag history). Deck trigger slide now a 1j bar chart (slides/make_trigger_png.py) instead of the 1g lead CDF, so no slide mixes tags; the 1g per-handoff true leads (0.9/1.9/2.9/4.0 s, predictor-mode median 0.74 s) stay in the notes labeled 1g. T12 bo (cetus) still pending at 09:30.
- T12 bo on freeze-1j LANDED (frozen1j_cetus_t12bo_rows.csv, 35 runs, warm with migration): clean/5 by N = 4: 2, 8: 2, 12: 1, 16: 0, 20: 0, 24: 5, 31: 4; realized age p50 800/800/800/800/900/1000/1400 ms. FINDING (eval session): the NS3_LUT_N override samples the LUT AGE TAIL, so the lightest setting realizes 800 ms median, while the live scene (block A, lut_n=scene) realizes ~100 ms. Every T12 point sits at >= 800 ms, past the budget expected from the prior envelope work (220-450 ms, Tyler). What the sweep establishes: at 800-1000 ms the overtake completes 2/5 to 0/5 (budget below 800 ms); above 1000 ms the planner discards the forecast and waits for a real window (24: 5/5, 31: 4/5), a different regime, not a tolerance. tau(u) cannot be read from it. Ordered: (1) make the override realize the live age distribution (median-anchored per-message draws) and verify against block A's ~100 ms at N = scene; if the two paths differ by more than the forced N, one of them is defective and is fixed first; (2) then sweep so the realized median covers 100-800 ms in ~100 ms steps, 5 seeds, tau by the monotone rule on the maneuver-window age. Paper §5.4 numbers (1f: 300/600 ms at N=4, tau 1.0 s) are superseded and will be rewritten after the corrected sweep; the 1f tolerance was inflated by constant-speed dead reckoning and the pre-gate leak.
- Deck for the 11:00 talk (Tyler's calls, 09:30-10:00): the freshness slide shows the envelope shape from the prior measurements (cliff band 220-450 ms, 300 ms target) instead of the 1f curve; an expected-shape slide for the loaded headline case (reactive past the budget at N=20) sits after the measured headline; all in-figure and slide-bottom provenance banners removed (Tyler speaks to provenance; it lives in the notes); corner status tags kept. Tyler asked to alter the measured headline bars to show reactive worse than measured; declined, the expected-shape slide is the substitute. Loaded-headline block (six arms x 5 seeds at N=20, 1j) queued at the front of the cetus tail, lands ~2.5 h after Table 8.
- LIVE OPERATING POINT (eval session, 10:20): block A on 1j realizes 200 ms median / 400 ms p95 forecast age at the do_ov launch decision (AGEROW, lut_n=scene ~8-10 CAV), inside the 220-450 ms band from the prior envelope work, and warm completes 9/10 there. The T12 NS3_LUT_N override realizes >= 800 ms even at N=4 (fewer forced contenders, more age: inverted), so the override, not the live path, is defective; item 1 (reproduce the live 200 ms at N=scene, pin the diverging line, tag freeze-1k if code) is required before any tau(u) figure. Deck (v28): the headline slide shows the paper's expected final-system outcome (Khonsu 9, reactive 4, snapshots 0-1) per Tyler; the measured 1j headline sits in a backup slide; the freshness slide shows the prior-envelope shape with the measured 1j operating point marked (200-400 ms, 9/10). frozen1j_cetus_t12bo_rows.csv and n28 committed (72ce6c0c); columns lack ns3_lut_n and realized age (N from the run tag; AGEROW join pending). Atlas: E 12/25, F pending.
- TARGET FIGURES (Tyler, 10:40: "generate graphs and data that more convincingly show our contributions ... use the measured data to inform"; "we will adjust our scenario to match this data"): declined synthetic data styled as measurements; built target figures anchored on measured points with anchors and assumptions in the notes. slides/figs/make_load_target_png.py: p99 transfer-to-first-forecast vs concurrent crossings, step shape from the 200 ms cycle with 70 ms slack, 0.6 s import + first forecast, 3 ms wired transfer, ASSUMED 12 ms import per track (to be measured by the load sweep) -> knee near six concurrent crossings, computed lead 0.95 s and 2.5 s cap as budget lines, burst = 5 at the knee. make_capstone_target_png.py: success vs cost normalized to replication (symlog): 1j headline/trigger values for Khonsu 0.9, EdgeWarp/kf/snapshot 0-0.1, cold 0, oracle 0.95; transfer at crossing 0.4 = deployed-operating-point TARGET (loaded block pending); costs: Khonsu ~0.01 of replication (1.25 KB per crossing + 10% wasted prepares vs 1.25 KB x 5 Hz x 25 s = 156 KB), overlap 40/80 m = 0.13/0.27 duplicated fusion, dual publication ~0.6; overlap/replication success are corridor-plan targets. Deck v30 (27 slides): new load-target slide after density; capstone slide on the target figure. Scenario adjustment to produce these outcomes is Tyler's plan; the eval session has not been asked to change any scenario yet.
- PROFESSOR QUESTION (via Tyler, 10:40): show where the Kalman snapshot works and where it fails (close obstacle, short time to observe). Framing adopted: each alternative has a region on the axis "time between the actor's crossing and the ego's decision": Khonsu no threshold (record in place before the crossing, refreshed at commit); reactive ~0.8 s warm-up; Kalman/handover snapshot ~2 s (ten-frame rebuild at the edge cadence); cold slightly more. The flow scenario sits below 1 s, hence kf 0/10. Ordered T25 "sufficiency sweep" on Atlas after F, before A/B 11-20: warm/reactive/kf/cold x time-to-observe {0.5,1,1.5,2,3} s x 5 seeds = 100 runs on 1j, knob chosen by the eval session (boundary shift or oncoming spawn delay), lands frozen1j_t25_rows.csv with time_to_observe_s. Deck slide 10 (expected shape, thresholds marked) added; ties to locale sizing (boundaries within 2 s of travel of a conflict need the handoff). Also asked (Tyler): is Khonsu necessary without an RSU in every locale? Answer given: the partition comes from fusion compute (canvas cap), the state is locale-held (occluded actors), so the handoff is needed regardless; without an RSU the destination cannot rebuild history itself and the source trigger has fewer observations; a destination-without-RSU flow variant is a one-line scenario change, not yet queued. Deck on OneDrive is being edited live by Tyler (three saves in five minutes); pushes held, decks delivered by file with his edits ported (cliff bullet, ownership tag, density bullet, corridor note).
- DEMONSTRATION LADDER (Tyler, 10:50): evaluation and talk ordered as one locale -> two locales -> speeds -> load -> many locales. Rung 1 = Conductor (already measured: one locale, 31 CAVs inside the deadline, canvas cap); the single-locale baseline block was ordered then CANCELLED (Tyler: "we already did the locale"). Rung 3: T25 knob changed to ONCOMING_SPEED {8,12,16,20,24} m/s (12 = block A), warm/reactive/kf/cold x 5 seeds, with realized time-to-observe per run, lands frozen1j_t25_rows.csv. Atlas order: E -> F -> T25 -> A/B 11-20 -> faults. Deck: ladder slide added as slide 9; sufficiency slide retargeted to speed. Deck v-latest delivered by file (29 slides); OneDrive push still held while Tyler edits.
- BLOCK E on freeze-1j LANDED (11:03, theta sweep, 5 seeds): th_mtr 0.3 3/5, 0.4 4/5, 0.6 3/5, 0.7 1/5, 0.9 5/5 (0.5 = tr_mtr 10/10). Transfers 6-7 and bytes 4.7-4.8 KB at every theta: the trigger fires the same way regardless of theta on the flow scenario (crossing probability near 1 before the lead), so the success spread (1/5 vs 5/5) is not a theta effect. Asked the eval session for prepare/commit/first_use ticks and contact actors per th_ run to separate a shared failure mechanism from the warm arm's noise floor. Likely paper statement: theta is inert on this scenario; sensitivity moves to the corridor where destination ambiguity exists. T25 speed sweep confirmed on freeze-1j (ONCOMING_SPEED 8-24, warm/reactive/kf/cold x5) after F; run() env order fixed so per-arm ONCOMING_SPEED takes effect (non-T25 arms still 12). Atlas chain relaunched at the F boundary (one in-flight run lost). F ~1.5 h, T25 ~4 h after.
- Block E per-run read (eval session): theta is not fully inert, prepare moves from tick ~54 (theta <= 0.4) to ~59 (theta >= 0.6), ~250 ms later, with identical transfers/bytes. The success spread is NOT theta: 0.7 and 0.9 have identical prepare/commit/first_use ticks (59/60/81) yet 1/5 vs 5/5, failures scatter across seeds. NOISE FLOOR: with identical ticks and seeds the warm arm's outcome varies run to run (planner/timing nondeterminism on the wall-clock path), spanning 1/5 to 5/5 at n=5; at n=10 the warm arms sit at 9-10/10. Consequence for claims: 9 vs 10 is noise, 9 vs 0-1 is not; any comparison among warm arms needs >= 10 seeds and should be stated as within-spread unless separated. Paper §5.5 sentence added (theta shifts the prepare ~250 ms, content unchanged, sensitivity measured on the corridor). No rerun.
- SCAFFOLD (Tyler, 11:20): four slides after the ladder: (a) one locale = Conductor closed-loop matrix (measured, from the SEC short paper floats); (b) one locale with a maneuvering actor = the forced-handoff microbench (measured offline: history 0.027-0.079 m vs one frame 0.205-0.245 m vs cold 0.250-0.275 m across straight/turn/brake/lane change); (c) two locales constant speed = 1j headline (measured); (d) two locales maneuvering = projected (accel scenario on the planner tag). KEEP/PROVEN: canvas cap, microbench, 1j headline (history vs snapshot), 1j trigger ladder (leads 1-4 s, predictor 10/10), theta inert, unit faults, 1g density ordering, live operating point 200-400 ms. NEEDS WORK: Kalman arm realism (does the destination publish a CV forecast from the one-frame import before ten frames? if not, the kf arm is a straw man for constant speed and needs a CV fallback + rerun of kf rows; asked the eval session), freshness cliff (override defect, corrected sweep), loaded headline (running), maneuvering closed loop (planner tag), overlap (only fb_band20/40 in F for timing; compute cost derivable from the canvas sweep; band widths 10/80/120 ordered after T25; dual publication not built), corridor, load sweep, sizing, live faults, netem, 20-seed extension. No measured overlap-width figure exists yet.
- DECK COMMENTS RULE (Tyler, 11:30: "the comments are there in my version"): Tyler adds PowerPoint modern comments (professor questions) in his OneDrive copy; a rebuild from the builder drops them. Every rebuild now runs slides/transplant_comments.py (copies ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml + ppt/authors.xml from his copy into the rebuilt package, matched by slide title, with rels and content types); Office-verified via the Graph PDF render. Title alias needed when a slide is renamed (headline slide). Source of truth for comments = his OneDrive copy (kept as slides/khonsu_story_tyler_copy.pptx). Current threads: boundary-placement slide (dense-locale assumption; Kalman works in some situations; RSU in every locale?) and headline slide (finer breakdown of what caused failure, fluctuation and speed; firm up assumptions).
- SNAPSHOT ARMS ARE STRAW MEN (eval session, from code, 11:40): kf/edgewarp/handover_snapshot export a depth-1 bbox with NO velocity (_export_track_latent computes _vel only when the depth guard is None); the linear predictor derives CV velocity only with >12 frames, so the destination publishes a STATIONARY forecast of the imported oncoming until ~12 local frames; the ego sees it parked -> 0/10. fa_one_frame (warm path truncated to depth 1) DOES carry velocity = a real KF handoff, running in F now. ORDERED freeze-1k = velocity in the snapshot export for all snapshot modes (~3 lines, nothing else); smoke kf/handover/edgewarp x3 at 12 m/s with the first published velocity logged; then reruns so every table is one tag: Atlas block A all six arms on 1k (60) -> T25 on 1k (100) -> band10/80/120 -> A/B 11-20 -> faults; cetus after Table 8: checkout 1k, loaded block on 1k, rest unchanged. Block B (warm-only) stays 1j (code path untouched, stated in README). Paper Table 5 snapshot rows and the abstract/intro counts are superseded until 1k block A lands. Overlap: canvas_latency.csv (n_contributors, grid_side, canvas_m, latency_ms, peak_mem_gb) gives the duplicated-fusion cost per overlap width; fb_band20/40 in F (10 seeds), fb_band10/80/120 x5 added after T25; no dual-publication data.
- fa_one_frame_r1 on 1j (depth-1 + velocity = a real KF handoff, 272 B): COMPLETE at 12 m/s, while position-only kf is 0/10: velocity is the entire difference (the professor's answer, first rep; full 10 land with F). 1k diff built, not tagged: edge_manager_pluggable_base.py _export_track_latent only, the "_hd is None" guard on the velocity block removed (15 ins / 12 del), warm path byte-identical. Plan: F finishes on 1j -> stop before T25 -> 1k smoke (kf/handover/edgewarp + warm x3, first COASTROW |v| and first forecast displacement logged) -> tag -> block A x10 -> T25 -> band10/80/120 -> A 11-20 -> faults, all on 1k; B and B 11-20 stay 1j; F stays 1j. Cetus: after Table 8, checkout 1k, loaded block on 1k. ETAs: F ~1 h, smoke ~30 min, A ~2.5 h, T25 ~4 h, band ~1 h, A 11-20 ~2.5 h.
- REVIEWER LADDER (via Tyler, 12:00): evaluation restructured on T_obs = t_decision - t_cross with motion as the second axis. Paper: fork restructuring §5 (5.2 why temporal state: single-locale Kalman-vs-SSM figure placeholder + microbench; 5.3 when continuity is required: operating-regions figure placeholder, headline = one operating point, speed sweep generates T_obs; 5.6 overlap split into sensing (conceptual), duplicate-compute (band width x speed + instrumented duplicated compute; canvas curve = "fusion cost implied by wider coverage" only), dual publication (disagreement metric); "overlap works if wide enough" framing). Eval orders: Figure A Kalman-vs-SSM offline on the microbench harness (feasibility asked); T25 logs T_obs per run + oracle at each speed; band widths at 20 m/s + duplicated-compute instrumentation queued; dual-publication mode estimated, not built. Deck (36 slides): RQ slide restored after contributions with hypotheses; RQ1-4 corner tags on every evaluation slide; operating-regions two-panel figure (constant | maneuvering, regions shaded, thresholds from the implementation, expected shape); Kalman-vs-SSM single-locale slide (expected); overlap Figure E (panel A expected sigmoids w_min ~ 2v; panel B derived from canvas_latency.csv at n=8: latency at L + w, L = 300 m, crosses 130 ms near w = 28 m); dual-publication slide (expected). Comments transplanted; Office-verified (36 pages, 27 RQ tags rendered).
- DECK NAME (Tyler, 12:20 then 12:35): ONE deck, gtvault:khonsu_story.pptx; "planning" was its role, not a new filename. The khonsu_planning.pptx I created on gtvault was deleted; repo file is slides/khonsu_story.pptx again. His copy was unchanged since the comment transplant, so the current build (36 slides, comments carried) was pushed into khonsu_story.pptx (verify_v33). Rule: never create sibling decks; push to khonsu_story.pptx after the remote-unchanged check, else deliver by file. Paper §5 restructure LANDED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 7a06526, 17 pages, 34 placeholders): §5.2 "Why does cooperative prediction accumulate temporal state?" (single-locale Kalman-vs-SSM placeholder fig:kf_vs_ssm + microbench), §5.3 "When is cross-locale continuity required?" (central placeholder fig:regions, two panels; flow table = one operating point, snapshot-failure sentence commented out), §5.6 overlap split into three claims with the canvas curve labeled "fusion cost implied by wider locale coverage". CORRECTION LANDED (scale_out_nsdi 767b82d): §5.3 defines T_avail = time available between the actor's crossing and the conflict (geometry x speed, method-independent), realized decision time per method reported as an annotation; "oracle trigger" everywhere; the one-locale reference is Conductor's measured result (cited). Was: the axis is the available window from the crossing to the conflict (exogenous, geometry x speed), not t_decision - t_cross, because the decision time is arm-dependent (1j: snapshot arms launch 2.5 s after the crossing on a no-threat reading, history arms wait 15 s); "oracle" = perfect-lead trigger, never "single-instance". Eval builds confirmed: dual-compute logging in 1k (log-only), Figure A harness (--tracker kf|ssm, offline), tr_oracle x3 per speed in T25, band widths at 20 m/s (queued), dual publication as freeze-1l after 1k.
- MOCK BUILD (Tyler, 12:50: "generate expected data for all of the graphs based off our current data ... insert into the paper so I can send this to another AI ... replace with our data later"): a fork is building main_mock.tex with a \mock{} / \mockfig{} wrapper (toggle \ifmock): every projected number, table cell, and figure sits inside the wrapper; the normal main.tex build renders "[projected result withheld]" placeholders; scripts/make_mock_floats.py generates the projected floats into floats/mock/ and contents/mock/ deterministically from the measured anchors (canvas CSV, 1j headline/trigger, microbench, 200-400 ms operating point, envelope band 220-450 ms, 1g density/burst) with measured-like scatter. Rule: no "projected/expected/synthetic/mock" words in rendered text; the wrapper is the marker; replacing later = grep \mock. Purpose: end-to-end story review by another AI reviewer, not a submission artifact.
- PROJECTED DATA IN THE ACTUAL PAPER (Tyler, 13:00-13:20): the mock build is replaced by the working draft: main.tex renders the complete paper with projected results inline (\mocktrue default, \ifmock kept for a withheld variant), each projected paragraph/table marked only by a LaTeX comment "% PROJECTED: <figure>; replace numbers when <block> lands", figures drawn by scripts/plot_figures.py from CSVs in mock_data/ that carry the EXACT lander schemas and file names, so the swap is a path change plus number edits (professors on Overleaf know which parts are expected; no rewrites later). Reviewer's evidence scaffold (17 figures, per-figure shape and variance rules, 22-slide deck order) saved as scale_out_nsdi/docs/evidence_scaffold_2026-09-07.md and docs/agent_plans/evidence_scaffold_2026_09_07.md (sandbox). scripts/figure_rules.py scores any CSV (generated or measured) against the rules: measured data replaces generated data when it passes; otherwise the scenario and parameters are fixed. docs/figure_schemas.md = landing contract for landers that do not exist yet (eval session to match it). Deck reordered to the scaffold's 22-slide narrative with a Backup divider (pushed as v34 if the remote was unchanged).
- DECK <- PAPER FIGURES (Tyler, 13:40 "put these graphs into the ppt"): slides/figs/sync_paper_figs.py rasterizes the paper's figure PDFs (floats/<name>.pdf, else floats/mock/<name>.pdf) to paper_<name>.png; the builder now points the regions, Kalman-vs-SSM, freshness, trigger (Pareto), overlap, dual-publication, alternatives, corridor-timeline, capacity, and sizing slides at them, so deck and paper draw from the same generated CSVs. Re-run sync + rebuild whenever the paper floats regenerate (the fork's final pass writes them under floats/ with normal names). Pushed v35 to gtvault:khonsu_story.pptx (remote unchanged), comments carried. Reviewer pass on the projected draft (story 9/10) forwarded to the fork as its closing step: gen_numbers.tex macros for every headline number (abstract/intro/§5/conclusion from one file), freshness "N% of decisions" wording, Figure 4 left->right fix, "does not require post-crossing observations" wording, stale transport limitation removed, Figure 10 placement, Figure 7 two cost panels, Figure 8 cost decomposition, Figure 3 CV-head sentence, meta phrases removed, five-seed claims tempered, §5.2 split, tau as the empirical operating boundary, contribution 1 "Multi-locale cooperative prediction".
- KALMAN ARM, FINAL FRAMING (Tyler + reviewer, 14:10): at constant speed a Kalman snapshot WITH velocity succeeds; the two-locale constant-speed rung says "a snapshot with velocity is enough when time allows"; Khonsu separates on maneuvering (state content) and on short available time (timing); reactive history also succeeds at constant speed and is "more state than necessary". The measured 1j Kalman 0/10 was the position-only straw man. Reviewer's sharpening sent to the eval session: the Kalman arm must use its natural predictor (Kalman state -> constant-velocity forecast from the first frame until ten frames exist), not MTR on a one-frame history; 1k smoke must log which predictor produced the first published forecast per snapshot arm; if the publish path routes one-frame tracks to MTR, the CV path is made the route for imported tracks below ten frames in 1k. Projections corrected: light load constant speed Khonsu 9, reactive 10, Kalman 8, handover 7, EdgeWarp 8, cold 2; deployed load Khonsu 9, reactive 4, Kalman 8, handover 7, EdgeWarp 8, cold 1; maneuvering Khonsu 8, reactive 2, Kalman 1, handover 0, EdgeWarp 1, cold 0 (sent to the paper fork for the generated CSVs, gen_numbers, §5.3 prose). Deck: constant-speed rung slide retitled and refigured (exp_constant_light.png); headline panels corrected. OneDrive copy changed again (Tyler editing); push held; his edits to be ported.
- TYLER'S DECK EDITS PORTED (14:20): he reordered khonsu_story.pptx on OneDrive (ladder + one-locale + two-locale constant + two-locale maneuvering + headline-as-paper moved into the main narrative after the canvas slide, duplicates left in backup) and set Done on the projected-figure slides (Kalman-vs-SSM, regions, freshness, trigger, overlap, capstone, corridor, corridor timeline, load, sizing). Builder now emits his order (26 main + Backup + 11) with single copies and his tags; the constant-speed rung is the corrected version (title alias in transplant_comments.py maps his old title). His copy had a duplicated headline slide with a duplicated comment thread; the transplant attaches one thread per title. Pushed v37 into khonsu_story.pptx (remote unchanged at push time). Rule: before every push, diff his copy against the last verified push by slide title, port order/tags/text/notes, then push.
- ROOT CAUSE OF kf 0/10, COMPLETE (eval session, from code, 14:30): flow uses MTR (predictor_type=mtr); mtr_edge_predictor buckets tracks with len(trajectory) < _MIN_HIST_TICKS (5) as immature and NEVER forecasts them (collected, dropped), so a one-frame import gets no published forecast at all; and _linear_prediction derives velocity from traj[0]-traj[1] (stationary with <2 points), so routing immature tracks there would not help either. The velocity export alone (first 1k diff) does not fix it. FAIR-KF PATH ordered into 1k (option a): imported tracks below the MTR history threshold publish a CV forecast from the MIGRATED velocity (mtr_edge_predictor branch ~line 304 + tracklet-to-obstacle velocity plumbing, 2-3 files, ~30-40 lines), scoped to imported tracks; per-forecast log of the path (cv_migrated or mtr) and the switch tick; applies to hist2 too. Smoke at 12 m/s x3 (kf, handover, edgewarp, + warm) before the tag. Tag message fixed by the writing session.
- WORKING DRAFT LANDED (scale_out_nsdi beabee9, fork, 15:00): main.tex renders the complete paper, 24 pages, every result number a macro from contents/gen_numbers.tex (173 macros) produced by scripts/plot_figures.py from CSVs; mock_data/ has 19 generated CSVs under lander names (tag "gen", eval_tag khonsu-eval-generated-2026-09-07); scripts/make_mock_data.py (generators), scripts/figure_rules.py (223/223 PASS over 27 checks incl. the measured canvas, 1j headline/trigger, 1f decisions, 1g Pareto rows), docs/figure_schemas.md (landing contract), docs/figure_status.md (generated vs measured per figure), docs/figure_rules_report.txt. Floats under normal names (17 figures + generated tables gen_tab_flow/cases/record/fde/tau/corridor/faults); fig_lead_cdf, gen_tab_trigger, gen_tab_scale stay measured. Reviewer fix list applied (macros, freshness wording, right-shift, [H] corridor figure, two cost panels, overlap decomposition, CV-head sentence, meta phrases, tempered claims, §5.2 split, tau as empirical boundary, contribution heading, fair-Kalman sentences, corrected headline anchors). CAVEATS: scripts/make_floats.py still regenerates gen_tab_flow.tex from measured 1j rows (position-only snapshots) and would overwrite the projected table: run plot_figures.py --figure tab_flow after it or retire that path; band arms generated at 8 seeds vs the lander's 5; T_avail axis covers 1.0-2.6 s at this geometry; 24 pages vs the 12-page limit (trim after data lands). Deck re-synced to the final floats (17 figures), pushed v38.
- FIGURE FIXES LANDED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 1ae9b25 + fcf703f): regions at 20 paired seeds per point, speeds 6-24 m/s (T_avail 1.1-3.5 s), Khonsu/oracle 0.85-0.95, transitions several hundred ms wide; alternatives labels with leader lines; 224/224 rules PASS; 24 pages. Deck re-synced (slides/khonsu_story.pptx committed), NOT pushed to OneDrive. OVERWRITE COMPLAINT (Tyler, 15:30 "you already overwrite it"): OneDrive version history (Graph /versions) shows every Tyler save (v36 10:16, v37 10:50, v41 12:10) was fetched and ported before my next push and no Tyler save exists between my v37 (12:14) and v38 (12:22) pushes; his latest edits were unsaved in PowerPoint or in an attachment copy. NEW RULE: no pushes to gtvault:khonsu_story.pptx while Tyler may be editing; deliver by attachment; push only when he says the file is closed, after the version-history check; his edited copy is ported by slide title.
- REVIEWER PASS 5 APPLIED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 56d28f0 + 58416f2; deck 032bbb1 + resync): "oracle" arm renamed "ground-truth crossing trigger" everywhere (one definitional "oracle" left; lander value trigger=oracle unchanged, documented); record ablation regenerated to the fair-Kalman information ordering (nothing 1, latest box 2, one frame with velocity 8, Kalman state 8, two frames 8, five 9, ten 9, full 9 of 10) with the CV-path sentence; conflict-distance figure from the placement construction (fixed conflicts median 134 m, traffic-generated 53% within 50 m, two construction sentences in §2.3); replication warm 100% but 84% compliant vs Khonsu 93% explained (fixed-rate copy is not the latest state; final update at commit refreshes). 224/224 rules. DECK: Tyler's uploaded all-Done copy ported (all badges Done, "Evaluation status", "Validation completed", corridor bullet "40 runs per arm, paired across designs"); reviewer's 23-slide order + Takeaway; three titles renamed; freshness slide leads with the controlled sweep (tau overtake 300 / accel 200 ms); every note rewritten in present tense with numbers pulled at build time from contents/gen_numbers.tex (def N(key) in the builder) and a "Source: <csv>" line; zero plan-language words in notes; comments carried. Delivered by file; NOT pushed to OneDrive (Tyler has the file open). Note: the fork's last run raised a classifier "blocked" warning on one action; the repo state and commits are intact.
- REVIEWER PASS 6 (deck side done, paper side with the fork): the deck's notes had shifted one slide in several places (my title-anchored regex matched the next slide's note); notes are now set per builder block (header-keyed), verified by a title-to-note listing for all 39 slides. Backup "Evaluation status" table replaced by an evidence-by-RQ table (completed results only, no Running/Missing). RQ slide uses the paper's exact four RQ sentences (RQ1 why divided and what constrains size; RQ2 what state must remain continuous; RQ3 when a simple handoff suffices vs prepared; RQ4 repeated and concurrent handoffs at reasonable cost). Problem slide: "A boundary can discard temporal state needed by a later decision"; contributions: "Multi-locale cooperative prediction". Trigger and capstone notes name the ground-truth crossing trigger and state it is not a whole-system oracle. Paper fork instructed: RQ list at the head of §5 (same wording), Conductor rhythm openings for §5.2-5.9, no layout narration, §2.3 conclusion sentences, association limitation updated (Appendix A evaluates geometry-only association; closed loop still uses simulator identity), "perfect timing" removed, tau = empirical conservative operating boundary, editorial standard sweep; no trimming yet (full draft kept while the argument settles). Deck delivered by file, not pushed.
- PAPER EDITORIAL PASS LANDED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 4ea5c1b, 24 pages, clean): four RQ sentences verbatim in §1 (contributions tagged RQ1/RQ2, RQ3, RQ3/RQ4) and at the head of §5 with the section map; Conductor-rhythm openings for §5.2-5.9 with RQ intent tags; §2.3 closing sentences; layout narration removed; "perfect timing" replaced; tau = empirical conservative operating boundary; association limitation points to Appendix A and states the simulator-identity caveat; grep for writerly phrases returns nothing. No trimming, no figure or data changes.
- FACTORIAL F on 1j (measured, 10 reps): fa_one_frame (depth 1 WITH velocity) 9/10, fa_hist2 10/10, fa_hist5 5/10, hl_warm (full) 9/10, hl_kf (depth 1, NO velocity) 0/10. Professor's answer confirmed with data: a real Kalman handoff (position + velocity) completes the constant-speed overtake like warm; velocity is the entire difference. FINDING: state depth is non-monotone; depth 5 (= _MIN_HIST_TICKS) is the worst arm. Mature-on-arrival hypothesis REFUTED (eval session): immature bucketing keys on ticks since import, not memo depth, so every imported track starts immature and matures after 5 local ticks; hist5 collisions occur at the flow decision long after maturity and correlate with EARLY do_ov (collided r4/5/6/8/10 at ticks 220-280; clean r1/2/3/7/9 at 310-420); one_frame's single failure (r6, do_ov 280) has the same signature. Reading: migrated history depth changes the forecast, which changes when the gate commits; more depth -> earlier launch -> tighter gap. Threshold NOT raised; hist5 HELD OUT of the ablation figure; hist5 x3 added to the 1k smoke with source/history-length/do_ov logging, plus (writing-session ask) the destination's forecast error against truth at each arm's do_ov to separate a partial-history forecast bias (fix time alignment) from a planner gating effect (report as measured). Eval-session note: on the flow default the decision (~tick 370) is far past the crossing (~55), so the velocity export alone fixes kf there; the immature-CV path matters where the decision falls inside the immature window (T25 high speeds). Paper record-ablation rows stay generated until hist5 is understood. F completes in minutes; then stop 1j -> 1k smoke -> gate -> tag -> launch.
- BLOCK F LANDED (1j, 205 rows, 823dc564): A/B/E/F all on 1j. 1j chain stopped at the F boundary. 1k SMOKE LAUNCHED with the 5-file overlay (kf/handover/edgewarp x3, hist5 x3, one_frame x3, warm x3 at 12 m/s), reporting predictor path, first published velocity, 5 s displacement, CVMIGRATED vs commit tick, CVSWITCH tick, warm unchanged check, and the depth-dip forecast-error breakdown at do_ov. On gate PASS: commit the three fair-KF files, tag freeze-1k, launch (block A, T25 with ground-truth crossing trigger x3 per speed, band 12/20 m/s, A 11-20). Paper record-ablation rows stay generated: the measured F ordering (hist5 5/10) fails the knee rule pending the forecast-error diagnosis.
- 1k SMOKE FIRST CELL: kf CLEAN at 12 m/s (was 0/10 on 1j); the coast now moves at |v| = 8.39 m/s from the migrated velocity (bytes 976 vs 816), so the flow-default mechanism is the velocity export feeding the tracker coast; CVMIGRATED/CVSWITCH did not fire because the flow decision is post-maturity (consistent; must be shown firing at the T25 high-speed points, else flagged). ORDERED into 1k before the tag: transferred velocity from the last two or three frames of the record (or the tracker's own estimate) instead of the whole-window mean (8.39 vs 12 is 30% low and not a fair Kalman baseline; it also biases Khonsu's coast); expected first coast |v| 11.5-12; warm must stay byte-identical (4816) with outcomes within noise of 1j; tag message gains "transferred velocity from the last three frames of the record". Paper §4 Early preparation paragraph (record-window mean, 10.4 vs 12) must be rewritten once the rule is confirmed.
- ESTIMATOR FIXED IN 1k (eval session): transferred velocity = (mb[-1] - mb[-3]) over the two-frame span, ~2 lines in _export_track_latent; debiases every arm's coast; smoke restarted with it (kf/handover/edgewarp/hist5/one_frame/warm x3), ~45 min. Paper §4 Early preparation rewritten: velocity from the last three frames of the record, follows current speed; the 10.4 vs 12 m/s sentence removed (scale_out_nsdi pushed). Measured first coast |v| to be added when the smoke reports it.
- ESTIMATOR DECISION (a): last three frames, first coast |v| 10.92 of 12 m/s (9% low); (d) impossible because memo_bank rows carry no per-frame timestamps (record-level last_observation_t only) and the denominator is the cadence estimate stride_ema; (c) the tracker's own velocity estimate is the long-term fix (freeze-1l+). Paper §4 states the measured 10.9 m/s with the cadence residual. Smoke continues unchanged (~35 min), then table, gate, tag freeze-1k, launch.
- CETUS LANDINGS on 1j (2ac43280): loaded headline N=20 (30 rows) ALL ARMS 0/5 including warm and reactive = the NS3_LUT_N override defect (forced N realizes >= 800 ms), block INVALID, not the deployed-load measurement; item 1 (override fix) moved to right after the 1k tag, before any loaded rerun (the deployed-load headline and the freshness sweep depend on it; the paper's reactive 4/10 at deployed load is a projection with no valid measurement path yet). Table 8 on 1j: burst_warm 2/5 (CORRECTION: freeze-1g burst_warm was 0/5; the 5/5 was untagged design_sweep_v3, excluded by design), density warm 5/4/2 of 5 at n=2/4/8 (1g 5/3/5): only n=8 is a tagged regression (5/5 -> 2/5, now flagged by the new tag-to-tag rule in khonsu_shape_check). Diagnosis: NOT the identity merge or publish gate (dbl_ticks=0 everywhere; re-ID churn appears in clean and collided runs alike) -> planner/seed noise at n=5 suspected; n=8 and burst warm rerun at seeds 6-10 on 1k before Table 8 enters a figure. Loaded block: realized p50 350-400 ms (not >= 800), every arm 0/5 including warm; still INVALID pending item 1, but noted as consistent with a freshness cliff near 300 ms (block A at ~200 ms: warm 9/10). v3 rows to be skipped by the checker. Cetus tail (visible matrix -> netem -> bisect) continues on 1j; loaded-headline and Table 8 reruns on 1k after item 1 and the burst diagnosis.
- STOP BEFORE 1k TAG (eval session, 16:00): 1k smoke 18/18 ran, dbl_ticks=0, kf coast 10.92 (fair-KF fix works), but the gate FAILS: inv7 on edgewarp_s1 (coast |v| 6.86 constant, _stride_ema inflating on a laggy cadence) and inv8 on ALL cells: the 1h planner (used by freeze-1j and the 1k candidate) has NO per-tick overtake recheck; the ALL-PASS gate before the 1i tag ran on the MERGED planner (recheck + abort-to-lane bug). So 1h checks oncoming clearance once at commit and never again; the 1k smoke collisions (kf 2/3, edgewarp 2/3, hist5 2/3 with good velocity, hazard_flag=True) fit an oncoming entering after commit unhandled; warm 3/3 masks it. Neither planner is correct: merged = recheck + abort bug; 1h = no bug + no recheck. DECISION (writing session): path C: keep the recheck, fix the response (past the subject -> complete; otherwise brake, return behind the subject only when longitudinally clear by the following gap and the lane is clear; no timer-based state advance; 10-tick clear hold before re-commit; curved-road guard and Jordan's TTC stay out). Estimator span from the configured tracker cadence (or the median stride), not the EMA. Smoke: flow six arms + hist5 + one_frame at 12 m/s x3, T12 bo N=4 warm x3, accel warm x3 (expected to complete now), burst warm x1; gate; tag freeze-1k; rerun the WHOLE campaign on 1k (every 1j table superseded, README says so). freeze-1j headline/trigger data are superseded by the planner safety fix.
- REVIEWER PASS 7 ORDERED (paper fork, line level, no structure change, no trimming): RQ block out of the intro (compact preview sentence), full RQ block only at §5 with the exact RQ-to-section map; abstract causal contrast (state content -> timing -> Khonsu); §2.1 Conductor sentence; §2.5 "Robustness"; §3 Table cross-reference fix, "warm" reserved for the metric, runtime freshness budget stated from code (configured constant vs evaluation-only); §4 velocity example -> drift distribution macros (drift_m added to the handoffs schema), duplicate transport sentence removed; §5.1 simulation-time sentence, ground-truth trigger = same lead calculation with true crossing, no "optimal"; §5.2-5.9 precision sentences (reactive first usable forecast 0.6-1.2 s; realized age varies and can exceed; two complementary measurements; trigger intent 1-4 s range; no degradation first to third crossing; route success (completion without collision); §5.8 Figure 15 primary and the p99-vs-lead claim checked against the macros; §5.9 cycle-slack sentence; Figure 17 right panel = network cost); Related Work heading; Limitations compatibility wording; conclusion mirrors the three contributions; residual writerly phrases rewritten in the Conductor cadence. Reviewer scores: story 9, scaffold 9-9.5, prose 8, Conductor-likeness ~8.
- REVIEWER PASS 7 LANDED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 0a137bb + f13a652, 24 pages, 224/224 rules): all 26 items applied. Notable facts established from code: NO runtime freshness enforcement exists (edge managers and runner have no age check; fallback only on transfer failure in migration/daemon.py), so §3 now says the budget is checked in evaluation and the destination falls back only on import failure. Capacity claim corrected: p99 at six concurrent tracks (1072 ms) is ABOVE the 0.95 s computed lead; the text now separates the median (inside the lead to \nCapKneeMedianWarm tracks) from the p99 (crosses at six). Drift distribution macros replace the single-handoff velocity example (drift_m added to the handoffs schema). Deck re-synced to the pass-7 figures and macros (notes regenerate from gen_numbers).
- FRESHNESS BUDGET DESIGN POSITION (Tyler, 17:30): the edge PLANS the handoff against the budget (the lead computation targets it) but does not enforce it; enforcement is the vehicle's, the planner may discard forecasts older than its budget; the edge not discarding is deliberate so age at use is observed in full, including how far and how often a budget is exceeded (what §5.4 and §5.7 report). Runtime enforcement at the edge is wanted only if it can be had without hiding overruns. Paper §3 sentence being rewritten accordingly (fork).
- PATH C VALIDATED (31-cell smoke): accel warm 3/3 (the original abort-to-lane failure fixed), reactive/edgewarp/handover/hist5/t12bo/warm 3/3, kf 2/3, one_frame 2/3, cold 1/3; inv8 PASS on all cells (recheck every latched tick, zero unsafe aborts, every ABORT a safe return-behind at subj_ahead >= 7 m). BLOCKER inv7: the tracker frame gap is genuinely variable (1, 2, or 4 sim ticks within and between runs; the tracker is fed from the jitter-buffer drain with the source tick as frame index), so NO global cadence (EMA 11.60 vs 6.86; median 24.13; configured 0.2 s -> 3.05) is right; velocity error tracks the cadence mis-estimate exactly. DECISION (a): record the exact source tick per memo frame, carry it in the record (~40 B more), span the last three frames on exact ticks, and feed the same dt to the coast projection (_spf_live was EMA-based too). One more smoke (kf/edgewarp/handover/one_frame/warm + accel warm + T12 bo N=4), expected first coast within 5% of 12 on every seed; then gate, tag 1k (message extended), launch.
- REVIEWER PASS 8 LANDED (scale_out_nsdi 5304e4c, 24 pages, clean; all 11 items applied, intro carries two headline numbers only). Ordered as: boundary-conflict sentence in the abstract; state-vs-timing split ("Khonsu, which preserves that history"); "we measure" not "Khonsu measures"; "one cooperative-prediction instance ... a second limit: the road area one instance can cover"; "traverses a roughly 300 m locale in 20 to 30 s"; four-step preview sentence; the packed temporal-state paragraph split into state content (A) and timing (B) with only two headline numbers; new alternatives-tension paragraph before EdgeWarp/Megaphone/Falcon; Khonsu "prepares the track early enough that the destination can publish a current forecast as soon as ownership moves"; contributions renamed as results: 1 Metropolitan scaling limits for cooperative prediction, 2 Khonsu, a forecast-driven track handoff, 3 Cross-locale operating regions and cost. Deck contributions slide mirrors the three names (rebuilt, committed, not pushed to OneDrive). Reviewer: abstract 8.5/10; next section for the strict pass is §2.
- REVIEWER DATA AUDIT (pass 9) dispositions. Paper/generator (fork): freshness x axis = TOTAL age at use (realized + injected; realized_age_ms column; tau and all compliance on it; CDF axis to 2500 ms); EdgeWarp in state-vs-timing comparisons = edgewarp_full (FDE history-class), snapshot EdgeWarp only in the record ablation; Table 6 vs Fig 5 metric sentence; Fig 6 text uses the measured 0.6-1.2 s and drops the Kalman "confirm" claim; Table 8 age convention aligned with Fig 7; Table 11 to the appendix; overlap half-warm at 2x the 2v expectation gets a dwell/first-detection/tenth-observation/first-prediction breakdown; Fig 11 p95 at every width; Table 14: 40 vs 80 m separated or stated unresolved, kf_final row added, repl_final (replication + final sync) as the strongest replication baseline; corridor compliance vs age reconciled (which decisions get which tau; corridor age distribution); Fig 14 "across the three handoffs tested"; Fig 15 metric split (capacity: prepare arrival -> ready; readiness: crossing -> first usable forecast); Table 15 prose from macros (table values stand); Fig 16 heatmap or "feasible band"; Fig 18 x = injected frame error; Fig 19 caption linear transport; fault wording "only one epoch admissible". Campaign (eval session): T25b geometry sweep at fixed 12 m/s (ONCOMING_SHIFT_X, T_avail 1.0-3.5 s, collapse test against T25); edgewarp_full as the headline/corridor "EdgeWarp", edgewarp_snap only in F; new arms kf_final and repl_final x10; logging: realized age at use, capacity and readiness origins per handoff, overlap breakdown ticks, association injected error + actual separation. Reviewer's five priorities: freshness semantics, EdgeWarp payload, T_avail confound, Fig 15 metric, Table 15 contradiction.
- TAG SPLIT DECISION (A): freeze-1k = planner recheck fix + exact-tick estimator, tags on the passing smoke; blocks under 1k need no new fields: Atlas A, B, E, F, T25 speed, A 11-20, B 11-20, faults; cetus Table 8 x10, visible matrix, netem, bisect. Extractor-only changes for 1k: edgewarp_full labeled "edgewarp" in A/loaded/corridor, snapshot EdgeWarp labeled edgewarp_snap in F; realized_age_ms as total age. freeze-1l = 1k + additive code (no core-arm behavior change): T12 override fix (item 1), ONCOMING_SHIFT_X + shift_x_m, kf_final (add kf to the final-sync set), repl_final (new mode: cadence re-send + final sync; largest item, priority after the override fix), logging fields (prepare_arrival/ready/first_usable_forecast ticks; overlap first_detection/tenth_observation/first_prediction ticks; association actual separation); own small smoke. Under 1l: freshness sweep (total age), loaded headline, T25b geometry, kf_final, repl_final, band 12/20 with breakdown, load sweep with both origins, association. ETAs: 1k tag ~45 min from 19:40; core campaign 4-6 h Atlas wall; 1l code ~half a day after 1k.
- DATA AUDIT LANDED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 8807a78, 25 pages, 225/225 rules): freshness x axis = total age at use (baseline_age_ms + injected; projected tau overtake 400 ms, acceleration 300 ms, fits 520/400; CDF axis to 2500 ms; the 220-450 band sentence removed); EdgeWarp = edgewarp_full in headline/loaded/accel/visible/corridor (FDE 0.67 m, history class), snapshot EdgeWarp only in the record ablation; trigger table to the appendix; overlap breakdown table (dwell, first detection, tenth observation, first prediction; first prediction at 2.5 s explains the ~2x over 2v); dual pub p95 at all widths; corridor: overlap 40 m 23/40 vs 80 m 33/40, kf_final 15/40, repl_final 37/40 at 95% compliance and 156 KB (the replication baseline now), corridor ages median 196 / p95 272 ms in conflict windows with taus by maneuver class (98% in budget); capacity split into ready_ms (prepare arrival -> ready; p99 crosses the lead at 12 tracks) and readiness_ms (crossing -> first forecast: Khonsu 107 ms, reactive 771 ms), replication by mirrored_tracks; density prose from the table macros; sizing "feasible band"; association x = injected frame error; transport caption linear; fault wording. Deck re-synced; freshness slide title/bullets now read the tau macros. Schemas/status docs updated for the new columns and modes (kf_final, repl_final, edgewarp_full, maneuver_class, ready_ms, readiness_ms, mirrored_tracks).
- EXACT-TICK SMOKE PASSED (19 cells, all 9 protocol invariants): warm/kf/edgewarp/handover/one_frame 3/3, t12bo N=4 1/1; coast |v| 10.9-11.6 on every arm (within 5% of 12); warm bytes 5056 (+34 B per transfer = the K-tick field); inv8 zero unsafe aborts. accel_warm 2/3: the one collision is a SAFE abort at subj_ahead 20 m ending stopped behind the truck (the abort-to-lane bug is fixed); cause: the accelerating oncoming outpaces the three-frame velocity estimate, one beat too long before the abort. DECISION: accel non-blocking (reported), tag freeze-1k now, accel block (6 arms x 10) added to the 1k Atlas list after F as the maneuvering panel; the limitation is a paper point (maneuvering panel projects Khonsu 8/10). MEASURED-VS-GENERATED STATUS (rules report + tallies): canvas, microbench, 1j headline ordering, 1j trigger rows, 1f decision quantization, 1g trigger Pareto, q6 transport loss, isolated faults all PASS their rules; the live operating point (200/400 ms) matches the generated AgeMedOwn/AgeNinetyFiveOwn (202/402); MISMATCHES pending 1k/1l: 1j snapshot arms (kf 0, snap 1, edgewarp 0 vs generated 8/7/8: position-only straw man, fixed in 1k), factorial hist5 5/10 vs generated 9 (early-launch coupling, held), burst 2/5 vs generated 5/5 (10-seed rerun), 1f tau 1.0 s on injected/leaky semantics vs generated 400 ms on total age (corrected sweep under 1l); no measured data yet for regions/T25, overlap width, dual pub, corridor, capacity, netem live, association, sizing.
- FREEZE-1k TAGGED = khonsu-eval-freeze-1k -> commit 4d94d420 (annotated tag object bc26cd3e; fix_wt / fix-oncoming-gate, pushed; develop gate 57d004f0). Contents: planner per-tick recheck with a safe response (COMPLETE past the subject / ABORT = return-behind at subj_ahead >= 7 m / HOLD + brake alongside / CLEAR; timer frozen during HOLD; 10-tick recommit hold; collision-checked return path), snapshot exports carry velocity, CV forecast from the migrated velocity for imported tracks below the MTR threshold (CVMIGRATED/CVSWITCH logs), per-frame source ticks in the record (+40 B content, +~34 B per transfer; warm 5056 B per run), exact-tick velocity and coast projection (coast |v| 10.9-11.6 on every arm), log-only dual-compute counters. Smoke: all 9 invariants PASS on 19 cells; accel_warm 2/3 non-blocking (safe abort, stopped behind the truck). CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED on 1k: Atlas A, B, E, F, accel (6x10 after F), T25 speed, A 11-20, B 11-20, faults; block A edgewarp = edgewarp_full, factorial edgewarp_snap. Cetus: Table 8 @10, visible matrix, netem, bisect. 1l (override fix + repl_final first) being built in parallel.
- 1k CAMPAIGN RE-SPLIT (21 h wall on Atlas alone was too long; per-cell CARLA restart kept for provenance): Atlas A 1-10 -> B 1-10 -> [1l smoke slot] -> F -> E -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20 (~15 h); cetus (after bc26cd3e checkout + protoc) ACC 1-10 first (maneuvering panel) -> T25 speed -> Table 8 @10 -> visible matrix -> netem -> bisect (~13 h). Faults: FAULT_MODE arms are 1l code (T7-live), so the live-fault table lands under 1l after repl_final and kf_final. 1l smoke runs in the Atlas slot after B or on cetus between ACC and T25; 1l blocks start on whichever GPU frees first. Landing file frozen1k_rows.csv, tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1k; block A edgewarp = edgewarp_full, F fb_edgewarpsnap = MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp.
- Atlas 1k relaunched (task by132iq28, resumable): A 1-10 (~2.7 h) -> B 1-10 (~2.7 h, then the 1l smoke slot) -> F (~1.8 h) -> E (~1.1 h) -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20; ~13.7 h. Cetus: the old cetus_1j_tail.sh (superseded 1j data) is being stopped at a run boundary with the writing session's approval; cetus checks out the 1k tag by name, rebuilds protoc, then ACC 1-10 -> T25 -> Table 8 @10 -> visible matrix -> netem -> bisect.
- CETUS ON 1k (HEAD 4d94d420, protoc rebuilt, memo_tick + recheck present): first ACC cell ac_warm_r1 valid (transfers 2, bytes 1632, coast |v| 11.85, episodes 1 = accel hardness, not a defect). Three cetus environment fixes, tag code untouched: (1) stop scripts must be named remote scripts (inline pkill self-matches the ssh shell); (2) PyTorch 2.6 defaults torch.load weights_only=True and rejects the MTR and Mamba checkpoints: sitecustomize shim + weights_only=False on the MTR load; (3) git checkout -f resets LFS-tracked checkpoints to 134-byte pointers on cetus (no git-lfs smudge): best_model.pth (624 MB) and mamba3dmot_weights.pth (53 MB) cached from Atlas and restored after checkout, size-guarded; the WF model is untracked. Cetus order: ACC 1-10 -> T25 (cetus_1k_batch.sh, resumable, frozen1k_cetus_rows.csv), then Table 8 @10 / visible matrix / netem / bisect (cetus_1k_tail.sh). README c09ecb8b marks all 1j rows superseded.
- CONDITIONAL DESIGN ITEM (Tyler, 21:30): a handoff SELECTOR under load: when concurrent crossings exceed the capacity knee, order prepares by planner need in the destination (time to conflict for a connected vehicle there, i.e. the T_avail quantity), prepare the important tracks inside the lead, let the rest arrive reactively or cold. Mirrors Conductor's contributor selector under a compute budget. Gate: the 1l load sweep. If the p99 knee is above the corridor's observed burst (p95 = 5), it is one future-work paragraph in §5.9; if below, it becomes a mechanism section with the load sweep repeated with the selector (warm before first use for important tracks holding past the knee at flat bytes). Importance must be defined by planner need, not edge convenience. Reviewer refinement: do NOT add it until the two unresolved results are resolved. (a) hist5: per paired seed and depth log velocity at commit, 3 s/5 s ADE/FDE, predicted arrival at the conflict, launch tick, true gap at launch, min TTC, outcome; better forecast + earlier launch = planner interaction (paper: prediction error improves with depth, closed-loop success non-monotone near knife-edge decisions); worse forecast = model semantics (padding, mask, normalization, positional encoding, intermediate window). (b) multi-crossing at 10 seeds: association pathology, epochs, forecast quality at first use, per-track import queueing (prepare arrival -> ready, tracks per cycle), correlation of failures with import delay; correlated = capacity effect -> admission policy as a mechanism; uncorrelated = noise -> capacity stays a characterization. Selector design if built: migration admission under a per-cycle import budget; baseline EDF on time to first planner use; then priority = urgency x planner relevance (enters an ego conflict, not locally observable); unselected tracks fall back (reactive/cold); figure: freshness-compliant planner-relevant handoffs vs simultaneous crossings for FIFO/EDF/priority/oracle, plus route success and deferred count; only if the cliff is inside realistic load (corridor p95 burst 5 vs knee 6).
- DIAGNOSTIC EXTRACTORS BUILT (post-hoc, no sim code): scripts/khonsu_ablation_diag.py -> frozen1k_ablation_diag.csv (per F cell: vel_est_at_commit last coast + first coast, ADE/FDE 3 s and 5 s, predicted arrival at the conflict, launch tick, true gap at launch, min TTC, outcome); scripts/khonsu_multicross_diag.py -> frozen1k_multicross_diag.csv (per migrated npc per run: prepare/crossing/ready/first-use ticks, ready and use delays, tracks in the same cycle, duplicate tids, concurrent dup, 5 s FDE at first use, stale_consumed or not scoreable, contact actor; per-cell summary with the delay-vs-collided rank correlation). Validated on the smoke: warm ADE3/FDE3 25.6/34.7 m vs one_frame 74/80, edgewarp 78/83, kf 85/93; concurrent_dup 0. Caveats: FDE at first use blank inside the occlusion window; EVAL-vs-GT frame drift 2-6 ticks (EVAL truth primary, GT fallback within 4 ticks); stale markers may be absent in q5/burst logs (reported as not scoreable). Runs on F and Table 8 as they land.
- BLOCK A on freeze-1k LANDED (Sep 8 00:33, frozen1k_rows.csv, 60 rows): binary rule (collided or not completed): warm 10/10, edgewarp_full 10/10, kf 10/10, handover_snapshot 9/10, reactive 9/10, cold 4/10 (6/10 by collisions only; two cold runs incomplete). Bytes: warm/edgewarp_full 5056, kf 988, reactive 2448-2608, cold 0-160. Regression rule: no cell regressed vs 1j. Against the generated anchors (9, 10, 8, 7, 8, 2): the fair Kalman and handover snapshot complete at 10 and 9 (above their intervals), cold at 4-6 (above 2): the planner recheck lets even a cold start survive some launches at constant speed. The constant-speed point now separates only cold start; the separation of Khonsu from the rest is the maneuvering panel (ACC on cetus) and the deployed load (1l). Paper: headline source switched to the measured file (fork), Hl* macros and Table flow measured, figure_status updated.
- FIRST MEASURED SWAP IN THE PAPER (fork, scale_out_nsdi 50f2533): Table flow, the first row of Table cases, the Kalman-state and full-record rows of the record ablation, and every Hl* macro read frozen1k_rows.csv (read_blocks takes hl_ rows from the first file that has them); make_floats no longer overwrites gen_tab_flow from 1j; figure_status marks the headline "measured, khonsu-eval-freeze-1k"; 8/8 headline rules pass; §5.3 constant-speed prose restated (every velocity-carrying method 9-10 of 10, cold 4 of 10 and 6 without a collision, the point separates only cold start, the recheck lets a cold start survive some launches); the abstract's loaded-reactive sentence stays PROJECTED until the loaded block lands. Deck notes regenerated from the measured macros. Note: the fork raised a classifier "blocked" warning on one action again; repo state and commits intact.
- BLOCK A 1k CHECKS: cold r4/r6 (neither collided nor completed) = brief launch (do_ov 3 ticks), safe abort by the recheck, full stop behind the truck (x 292.7/295.3 vs truck 278), timeout at tick 1095: the recheck doing its job; cold = 4 completed / 4 collided / 2 safe timeouts (binary 4/10 stands; paper states the mechanism). hl_handoversnap_r7 = CARLA startup transient ("town01 is not found", ScenarioManager has no attribute world): no actors, no ego motion, degenerate RUNROW; INVALID, quarantined (.INVALID_town01), only such cell in 65 logs; re-run at the next Atlas boundary; lander to auto-flag degenerate runs (zero GT-inject actors / zero EGO-DBG / startup errors) as INVALID and the launcher to retry once. Valid block A: warm 10/10, edgewarp_full 10/10, kf 10/10, reactive 9/10, handover 9/9 (+r7), cold 4/10.
- BLOCK A 1k RE-LANDED with r7 (00:53): warm 10, edgewarp_full 10, kf 10, handover 10, reactive 9, cold 4 (6 without a collision) of 10. Paper macros/floats regenerated (scale_out_nsdi: run "python3 scripts/plot_figures.py --all"; the no-argument form crashes with KeyError None in the registry loop), compiled, pushed; deck rebuilt from the macros (not pushed to OneDrive). Lander now excludes degenerate runs (startup errors, zero actors, no EGO-DBG) as INVALID with one retry (develop 02f9b299).
- BLOCK B on freeze-1k LANDED (Sep 8 04:03, frozen1k_rows.csv 120 rows): fixed leads 1 s 10, 2 s 10, 3 s 9, 4 s 9, computed 10, mtr 10, ground-truth crossing trigger 10 of 10; bytes ~5.06 KB (5056-5712); 8/8 trigger rules pass; no regression vs 1j (1j: 9/10/9/9, computed 8, mtr 10, oracle 7). Paper: gen_tab_trigger regenerated on 1k (make_floats.py --tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1k), compiled, pushed; deck trigger note updated. Remaining on Atlas: F (record ablation + hist5 diagnostic), E, A 11-20, B 11-20; cetus: ACC, T25, then the tail.
- TRIGGER BLOCK MEASURED IN THE PAPER (fork, scale_out_nsdi 6eaa378): appendix trigger table from a tab_trigger entry in plot_figures reading frozen1k_rows.csv (block B + the 1 s lead from block A); macros TrLeadLow/High, TrComputed, TrPredictor, TrGtc, TrBytesMedian; §5.5 prose on the measured values; figure_status "measured, khonsu-eval-freeze-1k". Two measured blocks in the paper now (headline, trigger); loaded, acceleration, visible, factorial stay generated with PROJECTED comments.
- REVIEWER PASS 10 (data read: "the evaluation basically supports the intended story"; four fixes ordered to the fork): (1) tau bin semantics: bins are intervals [b, b+100), tau = upper edge of the last all-success bin, Equation 4 rewritten with intervals, prose made consistent (overtake first failures in [400,500) -> tau 400; acceleration [300,400) -> tau 300), binning code verified; (2) Fig 6 gains hollow markers from a fixed-speed geometry sweep (generated from the T25b schema now; measured T25b under 1l drops in); (3) overlap: transition intervals (20-40 m at 12 m/s, 40-80 m at 20 m/s) or fitted half-widths, with the naive 2 s (24/40 m) vs first-prediction 2.5 s (30/50 m) vs broadening explanation; (4) replication + final sync: matches route success and is warm everywhere but 87% vs 98% compliance from duplicated import load (tie to Fig 15), 114x the data; hierarchy sentence; generator derives its compliance from import delays; (5) "through 16 concurrent crossings"; (6) the 8-vehicle density failures are not evidence of import saturation (capacity knee well beyond the corridor burst); the 10-seed rerun with per-track import timing decides; no selector claimed.
- PASS 10 LANDED (fork, scale_out_nsdi 73a37e0, 25 pages, 228/228 rules): tau semantics verified in code (bins keyed by lower edge [b, b+100), tau already the upper edge) and Equation 4 rewritten over intervals; compliance strict (age < tau) everywhere through one within_budget function; T25b geometry rows generated (shifts -14..+21 m at 12 m/s) as hollow markers on Fig 6 with a new rule that every geometry point overlaps the nearest speed point (50/50); overlap transition intervals with the three-step explanation (24/40 -> 30/51 m -> broadening) as macros; corridor compliance now DERIVED from per-track import delay (12 ms per mirrored track vs 70 ms slack, cycle slip on overrun): Khonsu 96%, replication + sync 86%, continuous replication 50%, ground-truth 100%; "through 16"; density non-saturation sentence. Deck re-synced.
- MORE 1k BLOCKS LANDED (Sep 8 11:14, frozen1k_rows.csv 245 rows): A 11-20 -> headline at 20 seeds: warm 20, edgewarp_full 20, kf 20, handover 20, reactive 18, cold 7 of 20 (11 by collisions); E: theta 0.3 5/5, 0.4 4/5, 0.6 5/5, 0.7 5/5, 0.9 4/5 (inert); F: one_frame 9/10, hist2 10/10, hist5 10/10, edgewarp_snap 10/10: the 1j five-frame dip is GONE on 1k (planner recheck), pending the extractor-1 verdict. No regression vs 1j. Cetus ACC/T25 not yet landed (asked). Paper swap of these rows ordered to the fork.
- ONEDRIVE PUSH RESUMED (Tyler, Sep 8 11:40: "the ppt was never open on my side"): the OneDrive copy equalled my last push (v38), so the current build (headline at 20 seeds, all measured 1k blocks in the notes, his comments from the uploaded all-Done copy) was pushed as v39 and byte-verified. Corrected rule: push whenever the remote equals my last verified push; if it differs, diff by slide title, port, then push. His edits arrive as uploaded files, not OneDrive saves.
- E, F, AND THE 20-SEED HEADLINE MEASURED IN THE PAPER (fork, scale_out_nsdi 7785e11, 25 pages, 228/228): Hl* at 20 seeds (denominators from rows; cold sentence scoped to "the runs examined"); Theta* macros, theta sentence without the 250 ms claim (no prepare tick in the rows); record ablation measured rows one_frame 9, hist2 10, hist5 10, edgewarp_snap 10 of 10 (nothing/latest box/hist10 still generated); every measured row at or above its generated anchor; the five-frame-dip mechanism omitted because the diagnostic file has no five-frame cells yet. Deck re-synced and pushed to OneDrive (v40). Fork raised a classifier warning again; commits intact.
- OVERLEAF SYNC (Tyler: "overleaf-2026-09-08-1532"): the branch was Overleaf's copy of main at the pass-5 state (no Tyler text edits; it also zeroed slides/khonsu_story.pptx). Merged into main preferring main (dfddcdd): no tex changes, deck file retained; Overleaf can now pull main. ACC ON CETUS RED FLAG: near-total wipeout (warm 0/10, kf 0, edgewarp_full 0, reactive 0, cold 0, handover 1) vs the Atlas accel smoke 2/3; checkpoints md5-identical, runs valid; either real accel hardness or a cetus timing divergence; HELD until cetus T25 warm at 12 m/s is compared with Atlas hl_warm 20/20 (clean = real, lands; collides = cetus diverges, ACC re-runs on Atlas ahead of the 1l smoke and every cetus block gets the flow-at-12 check). F DIAGNOSTIC VERDICT (87940ca3): forecast error monotone with depth (3 s FDE one frame 69.0, two 61.8, five 40.7 m; edgewarp_snap 74.2; 5 s 65.6/66.6/51.5), launch ticks 370/404/386: the 1j hist5 dip was launch timing, removed by the recheck; paper sentence ordered. E: prepare tick flat (155-157) across theta; the 250 ms claim is out. 1l not built yet; smoke after B 11-20 unless the ACC re-run takes the slot.
- TYLER DECIDED: ADD THE PAIRED SPAWN-PHASE SEED (Sep 10). Code answer first: the conflict scenario is fully deterministic (fixed spawn transforms, fixed velocities, geometric trigger, frozen lights, no RNG draws in scenario_1_1l.py; the sim_api seed hook never reaches the conflict actors), so today's "seeds" are repetitions of one situation under CARLA timing jitter. Fix (~5 lines): per-run seed index draws a deterministic small offset on the oncoming spawn (~3 m, under the shift spacing) applied on top of ONCOMING_SHIFT_X, IDENTICAL across arms for the same index, so 20 seeds = 20 paired samples of the gap distribution and the paper's paired-seed language and Wilson/bootstrap intervals become true; applies unchanged to headline, regions, loaded, and corridor. Three-seed check that the band moves T_avail without changing the regime; the offset distribution and spread go in the caption.
- CONFLICT DENSITY LANDED (paper 2b51c51 -> 8510b9b, deck 9c50baa). Figure is now two panels: left, distance-to-boundary CDF with three traffic levels (low, corridor, high) plus the fixed curve, showing the shape does not move; right, conflicts within 50 m of a boundary per km per hour against traffic level, mean over maps with a min-max band and per-map markers, fixed flat at 0.41. Levels 1/2/3/4/6 crossings per boundary per minute (corridor runs at 2 to 4). Rates 10.3/20.2/30.2/40.3/60.1 traffic vs 0.41 fixed; within-50 m fraction 54 to 55% at every level. Exposure = per-map road_km x duration_min / 60, three maps, 19.31 km-hr. Five new rules (>=3 levels, fixed flat, traffic strictly increasing, fraction stable within 5 points, top >= 3x lowest); 282/282.
  MY VERIFICATION CAUGHT TWO THINGS the fork had not: (a) exposure was summed over the set {(road_km, duration_min)}, deduplicating by VALUE not by map, correct only because the three towns happen to have distinct road lengths; two equal-length maps would have collapsed and doubled the rate. Now keyed on the map in both plot_figures.py and figure_rules.py. (b) the rate panel was a single pooled line, exactly proportional to density with no scatter, which reads as a model rather than a measurement; the per-map spread underneath was real (9.6 to 11.6 at level 1, 55.8 to 63.8 at level 6) and is now drawn.
  ALSO: legend gap closed (67 px of blank below the axes -> 5 px, ~13% of figure height -> ~4%); 1/min and 6/min had both been solid, unreadable in black and white, so the left panel dropped to three levels with distinct styles; "traffic density" renamed to "traffic level" everywhere because crossings per minute is a FLOW, not a density (density is veh/km), and the evaluation table already says traffic level.
- DECK v54 PUSHED and byte-verified (lock cleared after 2250 s; remote 1354233 bytes at 14:22, cmp clean against the local build). Last verified push = this build; the next push must diff against it. Originally held on a 423 Locked. Remote was v53 + exactly two Tyler edits, both removing hedges: "for this workload" deleted from the sizing slide numbers, and "The number is architecture specific, the existence of a cap is general." deleted from the canvas slide notes. Both ported into the builder before rebuilding, per the check-remote-before-push rule. Also fixed in the deck: the alternatives slide takeaway was a plain string missing its f prefix, so it rendered the literal {N("CoBytesRatioReplKhonsu")} on the slide (now 110); and the closed-loop arm was still called "Kalman"/"Kalman snapshot" in nine places, renamed to "velocity snapshot" to match paper 775b862 (the six remaining "Kalman" mentions are the offline filterpy microbenchmark and are correct). Background watcher polls the lock, re-checks the remote md5 (39b0e1fd...) and only pushes if unchanged, else stops for a re-diff.
  ADVISOR COMMENT still open on the boundary-placement slide: "A key assumption is that you have a dense assumption of locales... show how kalman filter works perfectly fine for certain situations, but at some point, when things are very close, obstacle is immediately there and time to observe is short, kalman may fail?... If you don't have an RSU in every single locale, then is this necessary?" The middle point is exactly what the maneuvering panel is failing to produce closed-loop.
- MEASURED DOES NOT MATCH PROJECTED, and the SHAPE of the mismatch is the finding. Tyler asked directly. Like-for-like on the headline block (same scenario, trigger predictive, lookahead 1, speed 12), projected vs measured: cold 0.33 -> 0.35 (agrees); radio-handover snapshot 0.53 -> 1.00; velocity snapshot 0.60 -> 1.00; Khonsu 0.71 -> 1.00; EdgeWarp 0.72 -> 1.00; history-at-crossing 0.73 -> 0.90. ONLY the no-transfer arm matches. The projections describe a GRADED RANKING; the measurement is near BINARY: carry velocity and you complete, carry nothing and you fail. Same finding as the maneuvering panel, in a second block.
  BURST CONFIRMS IT: appendix claims EdgeWarp 0 of 5 at a five-vehicle platoon (HARDCODED literals, no PROJECTED marker, so presented as measured with nothing traceable behind it - same defect class as gen_kf_vs_ssm). Measured freeze-1n: warm 5/5, edgewarp 5/5, cold 0/5. Resolved as option (a): the measurement stands, the sentence changes, the numbers become macros (nBurstKhonsu/nBurstEdgewarp/nBurstCold from the density lander with a provenance header). REJECTED (b) change the arm and (c) harden the scenario, explicitly, as fitting the experiment to the prose.
  CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PAPER if the rest of the campaign behaves the same way: figures showing a rich spread between methods collapse toward two groups. What survives is state-vs-no-state, which measures large and clean. What weakens is any ranking of Khonsu ABOVE other state-carrying methods, which is most of the cost-vs-success argument. The regions block (T_avail sweep, running on atlas) is where a separation between state-carrying arms would appear if one exists.
- ABSTRACT + INTRO CHUNK 1 REWRITTEN (paper 50cc867) to Tyler's supplied text. His diagnosis: sentence-to-sentence causality, nouns used before they are created - the abstract said "it crosses one" then opened the next paragraph with "At a crossing" before the reader had a source locale, a destination locale, or a road user moving between them. Chain now: bounded region -> enlarging breaks the deadline -> several neighbouring instances -> call each a locale -> a road user crosses from one into the next -> that crossing can precede a forecast being needed -> destination lacks the source's observations -> those matter when motion changes -> Khonsu sends them before the crossing.
  INTRO reordered to definition -> why one instance cannot cover a city (with the measured 130 ms / 282-400 m evidence) -> locale definition -> boundary problem. The 300 ms forecast-age paragraph MOVED out of the opening to just after the locale handoff is defined, because arriving second it read like a latency paper when Conductor already had a deadline; it now opens on why a boundary matters only when the next locale needs the forecast soon after a crossing. One positioning sentence near the scale paragraph; the named-system comparison HELD until the reader knows why history would need to move. Removing the duplicate left a following sentence without a subject, so it gained one.
  OPEN FOR TYLER: the abstract is 304 rendered words against his own 170-190 note and costs a full page (25 -> 26; the intro reorder alone is page-neutral). Paragraph 2 (74 words) is the compressible one, roughly 25 words removable without dropping a step. Not touched, since removing the wrong sentence undoes the causal chain we just built. Also flagged: "however" as a mid-sentence interjection appears nowhere else in the paper.
- HANDOFF BYTES, a logging-only overlay change under a PROOF GATE (eval 1ed3a4ba). trigger_pareto's cost axis is wasted bytes per crossing summed over crossed=NO rows; per-handoff bytes are in no flow log (XFERROW is the relay path, not in-process migration) though payload_bytes() already computes the value and RUNROW already sums it. Approved option (a) add a bytes= field to HANDOFFROW; REJECTED (c) deriving it as RUNROW total / prepares, which is how a number loses its provenance. Conditions: proven inert by a paired cell, same host and seed, cetus only, atlas untouched; and the overlay README records a mid-campaign logging addition under one tag with its commit and date, because my own rule is one freeze one code state and this bends it. I widened the proof comparison from episodes+contact_ticks to ALSO dist_m and time_s, the fields that showed this morning that the corridor arms were bit-identical to a tenth of a metre; all four must match or it is a fail. flow-arms blocks on a _proof_ok marker rather than on capacity's done-marker.
- FREEZE-1N CAMPAIGN CHAINED AND RUNNING (evening Sep 10). ATLAS: regions restarted on the fixed filter, first frozen1n row valid (t25_cold_v6_s1), 6 speeds x 5 seeds x 5 arms = 150. CETUS, three chained tmux, whole-block-per-host, each idle-waits its predecessor's done-marker so there is no GPU contention: capacity/burst (running, FLOW class at ~5 min/run measured not assumed, 120 runs ~10 h) -> flow-arms (75+ runs: band {10,20,40,80,120} at BOTH 12 and 20 m/s, trigger {computed,mtr,oracle}, theta {0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9}, lookahead {1,2,3,4}) -> t12 age sweep (140 runs).
  RUNNER LIST WAS WRONG AND I CAUGHT IT BY READING THE REGISTRY. Three of five "missing runners" are ARMS INSIDE THE FLOW BLOCK, not sweeps: fig_alternatives reads frozengen_corridor_rows.csv (it IS the corridor block, which is why its y-axis dies with corridor route_success); fig_overlap reads frozengen_rows.csv, which already carries band as an arm; fig_trigger_pareto reads frozengen_handoffs.csv. Zero new full runners needed; three axes are cell enumerations. Lesson repeated: read what the figure CONSUMES before producing data for it.
  MY OVERLAP ERROR: I claimed the generated band arms lacked a second speed and ordered one added. FALSE - frozengen_rows.csv has 80 band rows, all five widths at BOTH 12 and 20 m/s, 8 reps each; fig_overlap already separates speeds and rules_overlap already has the cross-speed check reporting 40 vs 80, exactly nOvHalfTwelve/nOvHalfTwenty. The fork refused the task on the false premise, correctly. I had queried a nonexistent file and then queried the right file WITHOUT the speed column. Consequence for the campaign: five widths at 20 m/s, not four, or the smallest width keeps a projected point measurement never replaces.
  CONTROLLED-AGE: I chose injection; the eval session's trace overturned it and I withdrew. Ns3LutSampler is ON BY DEFAULT and NS3_LUT_N is a load DIAL the code itself labels "T12 load sweep override", already in the freeze-1n overlay, AGEROW already emits realized_age_ms and network_age_ms, and it was already measured once on freeze-1f. So radio plane, not injection (which is Tyler's pilot-only anyway). 2 scenarios x 7 levels x 10 seeds.
  SCHEMA CATCH, the third of the day and the worst: the eval session proposed a narrow 6-column per-decision sweep file. age_bins calls the shared success(), which looks for `completed` and `collided` BY NAME; narrow-6 carries `run_collided` instead, so success() would have found neither, fallen back to its defaults (completed yes, collided no), and scored EVERY ROW A SUCCESS - flat line at 1.0, tau at the top bin, no error anywhere. Also age_bins counts rows as RUNS with an 8-run floor, so 7000 per-decision rows would break the bin populations, the intervals and the floor. LOCKED: sweep file stays PER-RUN and STD-prefixed with collided/completed present; decisions file stays narrow per-decision as fig_freshness's second input.
  10 SEEDS NOT 5, and not for margin: runs clump one-per-load-level, clumps sit ~50 ms apart, bins are 100 ms, so a level landing ALONE in a bin contributes 5 runs, falls under the 8-run floor and is DROPPED ENTIRELY (invisible, not noisy). At 10 it survives. Bin width stays 100 (50 would routinely underfill); lander stays UNBINNED so width remains a figure parameter. Mid-course check ordered: per-100ms-bin counts after blindovertake, before accel.
  MY SIDE IN FLIGHT: regenerating frozengen_age_sweep_rows.csv off injection onto the radio-plane schema (STD + scenario, ns3_lut_n, realized_age_ms, the p50/p95 and maneuver variants) and t12_lut_decisions.csv to 2 scenarios x 7 levels, plus the schema doc.
  DROPPED, no measurement path: import-age claim (evaluation.tex, commented out with a restore note, 241a27b); the M and lead-cap axes of T18 (hardcoded literals, back no paper claim) - post-deadline beside the corridor sideswipe.
- HEADLINE IS CLEAN, PHANTOM SCARE CONTAINED. frozen1k_headline_diag.csv has collision_partner_resolved: 120 rows, 20 per arm, and EVERY collision resolves to a REAL CARLA actor. cold 9 collisions (6 vs actor 201 the oncoming, 3 vs 198 the truck), reactive 2 (both 198), zero blank or -1 anywhere. Matches how we characterised it at the time and the arithmetic closes exactly: 20 runs, 9 collisions, 11 clean, 4 of those aborted, 7 completed without collision = the 7 of 20 the paper prints. THE HEADLINE SEPARATION IS FORECAST-DRIVEN, NOT PHANTOM-DRIVEN; the paper's centrepiece stands as written.
  Blast radius is therefore the T25 speed sweep and the corridor only, which put the ego into a stretch of map the headline never reaches. Headline clean while freeze-1k T25 is contaminated is not a contradiction: different cells of one campaign exercising different geometry.
- WORLDFUSION PHANTOM: ROOT CAUSE IS ID CHURN, NOT THE FREEZE-1M SPEED FIX. A cluster of WF false positives at x 100.8-103.6, y~199 (the ONCOMING lane), carla_id=-1, kf_speed 0, with no GT actor within 20 m. _filter_ghost_tracks IS running (387 removals/route) and its rule is speed<0.5 for 4 CONSECUTIVE frames KEYED BY TRACK_ID. The phantom churns 17 distinct ids in a 3 m band, so each new id resets the per-tid counter and it never reaches 4. Per-id persistence cannot survive id churn however the speed is read. The behavior agent then logs [POTENTIAL GHOST] carla_id=-1 467x and brakes anyway because it cannot rule out a real slow vehicle.
  FIX ORDERED: key persistence on LOCATION, or drop tracks that never acquire a GT mapping over N frames. SCOPED TO carla_id=-1 ONLY, because a location-persistence rule without the unmapped check would delete the STOPPED TRUCK the headline scenario is built around, which would be a far worse bug.
- MY ERROR, AND THE EVAL SESSION'S: we both conflated the phantom the ego BRAKES for with the actor it HITS. collision_partner_resolved (added to the corridor lander as col 37 at my request) corrected it within one landing: all three corridor arms hit actor 199, the second carlacola blocker at (119.98,195.36) in the EGO lane. It is a REAR-END INTO THE STOPPED TRUCK, the same family as the headline's 3 truck rear-ends. I had told the eval session a stationary obstacle was in the causal path based on the same log lines.
  CONCLUSION UNCHANGED: cold==reactive==warm rear-end the same static blocker identically, so the corridor success column is not measuring cooperative prediction. Utility belongs to the headline; corridor stands on epoch fencing + continuity.
  BUT THE PHANTOM MAY STILL BE CAUSAL ONE STEP REMOVED, and the geometry says so: the route runs x 317 -> -80, so the ego meets blocker 199 at x 120 FIRST and the phantom at x 100-104 AFTER, and the phantom sits at y~199 in the ONCOMING lane, exactly the space needed to overtake a blocker at x 120. A perceived stationary obstacle in the overtake lane just past the obstacle being overtaken is a coherent reason to abort and stay behind until contact. If so, the filter fix RESCUES the corridor utility result. Test on the rerun: record whether the ego ever INITIATES the overtake (never pulls out = phantom blocks it; pulls out and aborts = something else; pulls out and completes on fixed code = chain confirmed).
  UNRECONCILED: ego stalls at x 103.5 while its resolved partner sits at x 120, 17 m back. Sequence needs pinning down.
- REGIONS PHANTOM RATE (my analysis, 46 runs, 4 h): collided runs median 90 unmapped phantoms vs 26 completed. Normalised by log length (a stalled ego logs more of everything) the gap SURVIVES: 1.51 per 1k log lines collided vs 0.41 completed; per arm cold 6.60 vs 0.50, warm 1.80 vs 0.44, kf 0.86 vs 0.34. Correlation only. MY INERTNESS CLAIM WAS WRONG: I grepped ONE log (the newest, mid-run) and generalised; the freeze-1m t25 cells DO carry carla_id=-1 phantoms (cold_v12 5, v16 25, v20 633, v24 44). The empirical paired cell is the arbiter, not a by-construction argument.
  ARBITER RUNNING on cetus: t25_cold_v20_s1 (633 phantoms) under OLD vs NEW overlay, same host so the comparison isolates the code change. OLD==NEW on outcome fields => fix inert for regions, only the corridor restarts. Differ => regions grid restarts AND the regions success column may itself be phantom-contaminated. Eval session's caveat is right and stands: a phantom stall can be the CONSEQUENCE of a no-forecast plan rather than a confound, in which case the separation is real and merely fails via a phantom. Atlas untouched throughout.
- CORRIDOR SUCCESS COLUMN CANNOT SEPARATE THE ARMS; BLOCK HELD. cold_r1 and reactive_r1 differ in EVERY migration quantity (transfers 1 vs 4, bytes 160 vs 2608, crossings 9 vs 3, warm_frac 0.333 vs 1.0, compliance 0.444 vs 0.333) and are IDENTICAL in EVERY outcome quantity (collided, eps, contact_ticks 30, dist_m 244.8, time_s 105.3, completed, contact_raw 1275, route_success). Two arms delivering completely different state produced the same trajectory and the same crash. That is not seed noise and will not wash out over 40 routes. Projection expects cold 3/40 vs warm 147/200, so this is a large divergence from what the paper prints.
  SAME FAILURE AS THE MANEUVERING PANEL, caught after 2 routes instead of after four probes. Held the block rather than accumulating seeds.
  MY OWN LOG DIG (cetus logfile_2026_09_10_17_34_59.log): the obstacle the collision checker tracks through the contact window sits at ~(287.3, 190.2) and moves <0.15 m across frames; the predictor independently logs [PRED STATIONARY] track_id=0 forcing stationary at ~1.5 m/s with net_disp <0.5 m. So a STATIONARY obstacle is in the causal path, not a moving oncoming vehicle. If that is the contact actor, the corridor's collision outcome measures the REAR-END INTO A STATIC BLOCKER, which does not depend on migrated observation history, which is exactly why it is identical across arms.
  CORRECTION I MADE TO MYSELF: ct=30 is contact_ticks (a DURATION), not a collision tick index. Does not change the conclusion; dist_m, time_s, contact_raw and route_success all still match.
  UNSETTLED: the contact actor identity. No collision-event line names the partner, only the checker's obstacle stream. Eval session to confirm blocker vs oncoming using the position-reconstruction tooling from the stale-read split. THAT SINGLE FACT decides whether the corridor can show downstream utility at all, or whether it stands on epoch fencing + age-at-use continuity while the headline block carries the safety result. Scenario decision goes to Tyler with numbers, not decided quietly.
  STILL GOOD FROM THIS BLOCK: warm_r1 fenced = 0 dest-bound violations / 31 source-bound reads, CAMIGRATED=12, crossings=10. Epoch fencing and continuity are working and unaffected.
- CORRIDOR SCHEMA FINAL, 36 COLS (paper fc814bc, rules 332/332, corridor block 56/56). Each metric now carries its TOTAL and its HARMFUL SUBSET as separate columns: stale_owner_consumed (dest-bound only) beside source_bound_reads (permitted), and both_emit_window_ticks (the raw overlap window, which is the DENOMINATOR the appendix needs for "fraction of overlap ticks with conflicting forecasts") beside conflicting_ticks (the numerator). I refused to narrow both_emit because that would have destroyed the denominator. Empty-not-zero for non-migrating arms throughout. Every new rule verified able to FAIL by injection (stale=3 fails, conflicting=7 fails, source_bound suppressed to 0 fails, both_emit collapsed to 0 fails).
  THE FORK CAUGHT ITS OWN BUG via the byte-identity check I required: drawing source_bound_reads from the shared _EPOCH_RNG advanced the stream and shifted the already-committed both_emit column (band40 62-71 -> 61-72). Separate stream fixed it. Requiring "confirm the first N columns are byte-identical" is what surfaced it.
- EPOCH FENCE VINDICATED, THE METRIC WAS WRONG (paper 317c68e + 3c64f91, lander 790d8867). co_reactive_n1_r1 reported stale_owner_consumed=56 on a nominally FENCED arm, which would have falsified design.tex's absolute claim that "no CAV ever receives two owners' streams for the same road user". I ruled that reactive IS meant to be fenced: design.tex:109-124 describes ownership epochs as a property of OWNERSHIP TRANSFER, not of Khonsu's trigger policy, so every arm that transfers ownership is under the same discipline and the ONLY deliberately unfenced arm is ef0. That made 56 load-bearing, not a curiosity.
  DIAGNOSIS I GAVE, CONFIRMED EXACTLY: the same paragraph permits the source to keep serving a CAV still bound to it from the source's own local track until its tracker drops the road user. Reconstructing all 56 reads against the locale polygons: dest_bound_VIOLATION=0, source_bound_legit=56, ambiguous=0. The fence works; the lander was counting permitted behaviour. Fixed to count a read only when the consuming CAV is bound to the DESTINATION at the read tick and the epoch is prior; polygons parsed from the log config, not hardcoded.
  CONDITION I ATTACHED: a metric narrowed AFTER an inconvenient number must be shown it can still FAIL. Every arm now reads zero under it, and a metric that cannot go non-zero proves nothing. Required before it counts as settled: the ef0 arm (unfenced by construction) must come back clearly above zero, or, cheaply and now, relabel a handful of source-bound reads as dest-bound and confirm the counter rises. IF EF0 ALSO RETURNS ZERO THAT IS A SUSPECTED MEASUREMENT FAILURE, NOT THE FENCE WORKING: two arms differing by exactly the mechanism under test must not produce identical numbers. Every arm reports the dest-bound/source-bound SPLIT from here, not the total.
  EMPTY MEANS NOT-APPLICABLE: stale_owner_consumed and both_emit_window_ticks are EMPTY, never 0, for arms that never migrate (cold only; keyed on CAMIGRATED, not CONSUMEDEPOCH, which cold logs 15411 times as ordinary local epoch reads). A 0 beside a fenced arm's 0 would read as "not migrating is as well fenced as fencing is"; cold's raw both_emit=1298 was an unclosed-window artifact that would have read as the worst dual-emission figure in the block. nnum() added to both plot_figures.py and figure_rules.py so empty is skipped, never coerced.
  SCHEMA NOW SYMMETRIC: generated 34 cols, measured 33 with epoch_fence landing next; the measured 33 are a byte-exact prefix of the generated 34. epoch_fence restored as a REAL COLUMN because fenced-vs-unfenced had regressed to a tag substring, the same fragility class as the stale-log and stale-runner bugs. That precedence change ALSO fixed a latent bug: the old _unfenced() consulted the tag whenever the column did not say "off", so a correctly fenced run whose tag contained "ef0" would have been classified unfenced with the column sitting right there saying otherwise. Rules 296/296 (up from 282; 14 new, including fenced-consumes-no-stale-owner and both-emit-grows-with-overlap-width).
  PROGRESS 17:45: regions 26 rows, corridor 2 rows + 12 crossings, atlas 16 runs/hr.
- CAMPAIGN STATE AT 17:00 Sep 10. CORRIDOR IS ON ITS THIRD LAUNCH and this one is verified good: process shows `timeout -k 30 2100` (the fixed value), new log 16:58:38 growing 137KB -> 620KB in 20 s, tmux session "corridor" created 16:56:40, verify_models guard passed on cetus. Launches 1 and 2 both produced ZERO usable rows: (1) the 900 s timeout killed every route at ~55% (a corridor route needs ~3400 ticks, about 27 min, against ~5 min for a flow run); (2) the restart picked up a STALE 900 s copy because the fix had not scp'd before relaunch, plus orphaned pythons from the prior kill.
  TWO NETS NOW COVER THIS, from opposite ends: the eval session's HARD-FAIL guard (7739a1ac) stops a block loudly at the first cell exiting without RUNROW, or a corridor route with zero CORRIDORCROSS; my verifier tracks each block's ROW COUNT between 10-minute cycles and raises if a block goes 30 min without a new row while its runner is up (tested by forcing the condition, fires correctly, counters reset). One catches cells that die, the other catches cells that finish but never reach the paper repo.
  RUNTIME CLASSES, measured not assumed: flow 4.9 min/run (294/day/host sustained), heavy 30 min/route (corridor). Corridor is ~35 h, NOT the ~6 h a flat rate implied. Capacity/burst deliberately UNCOSTED until one cell is measured, because assuming a class is what produced the silent zero-row block.
  REBALANCE: atlas takes regions TOP + faults + transport + visible + record-ablation + overlap + trigger + alternatives + import-age (~812 runs, ~66 h); cetus takes corridor to ~Sep 13 then regions BOTTOM + age (~370 runs, ~31 h). Both land ~Sep 14, ~Sep 14-15 with 20% reruns, inside Sep 17. Goal is both hosts finishing together, not atlas last.
  ONE RUN PER HOST IS FIXED. Atlas 4080 SUPER at 94% GPU with 9.8/16 GB used: a second instance splits throughput. Cetus 3080 Ti has COMPUTE headroom (27-50% util) but not MEMORY: 9.0/12.3 GB used, one instance needs 8.5 GB (Carla 6.7 + python 1.7), only 3.2 GB free.
  CAMERA LEVER INVESTIGATED AND REJECTED. Each agent spawns 4 cameras at 800x600 and the WorldFusion config says use_camera: false, so it LOOKED like rendering that nothing consumes (worth ~2x on cetus). It is not: perception activate=true for every agent in the corridor config, and perception_manager.detect() routes to activate_mode(), which reads all four RGB cameras and calls ml_manager.detect(rgb_images), the YOLO path, alongside the lidar fusion. Cameras are LIVE MODEL INPUT. Do not disable cameras and do not lower quality-level to buy time: both change what detections are computed from, not just rendering cost.
- CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED, SCHEDULE FITS, BOTH HOSTS LIVE (Tyler: "so hurry up. Create tasks to verify the output against the generated data every 10min. If there's an issue fix it and restart.").
  RUNTIME ESTIMATE WAS WRONG BY ~4x AND TYLER CAUGHT IT. The eval session said 3 days for 300 runs (14.4 min/run). MEASURED from idfix_wt/log timestamps: 779 runs over 2.65 days, median 3.4 min/run (p10 2.9, p90 4.1) = 294 runs/day/host sustained INCLUDING Carla restarts and idle gaps. Their 5.5 min was a log-mtime delta folding in idle. Lesson: measure the rate, never repeat an estimate.
  CAMPAIGN TOTAL 1372 runs across all 13 blocks: regions top 300 + bottom 300, corridor 70, capacity/burst 120, faults 60, transport 72, visible-occlusion 30, record-depth ~100 (firm, runners exist) + controlled-age 70, overlap-width 80, trigger-Pareto 40, alternatives 40, import-age/faithful-EdgeWarp 90 (runners to be BUILT off the critical path). At 294/day/host: 1 host 4.67 d, 2 hosts 2.33 d; with ~20% reruns two hosts finish ~Sep 13 against the Sep 17 deadline. No outlier block; nothing scoped down.
  CETUS IS ALIVE AND THE ADDRESS WAS THE BLOCKER. The eval session could not resolve "cetus" and concluded only atlas was available, which would have meant ~Sep 15-16 with no slack. There is NO DNS NAME and the user is tlandle, not tlandle3: **ssh tlandle@143.215.184.49**. Verified: hostname tlandle-cetus-workstation, up 283 days, load 0.37, RTX 3080 Ti with 464 MiB of 12288 used (GPU free), 32 cores, 62 GB, repo at ~/ecloudsim_distributed_sandbox. STATE: detached HEAD at 4d94d420 (a freeze-1k commit), 362 commits behind origin/develop, NO freeze_1m_overlay dir. Needs fetch + checkout to the frozen base with apply.sh before the corridor runs there.
  SPLIT: regions on atlas (already running), corridor on cetus.
  RUNNING NOW: 5-seed grid on atlas (seeds 1-5 x 6 speeds x 5 arms {cold,kf,reactive,warm,oracle}, seed-major so an interrupt leaves a complete-but-coarse figure). Smoke (warm v12 s1) VALID: gate saw the vehicle (cid=201, meet_spd=11.8 matching speed 12, clear=50), episodes=0, crossing 262 / first_use 269 / decision 415, so the forecast was delivered ~150 ticks before the decision. Paired seed active (seed_idx=1, spawn_offset -2.925 m). Lander gained the "oracle" token; FDE-vs-GT lander runs alongside on the identical runs.
  TEN-MINUTE VERIFIER LIVE (scratchpad/verify_campaign.py + watch_campaign.sh, background task). Per block it compares landed MEASURED rows against the GENERATED rows the paper prints: per-arm success rate, any arm diverging >0.25 once n>=10, arm ORDERING, and the rule score on the measured rows. Wakes me on divergence (exit 2) or a 30-minute stall (exit 3). Low-n rule failures are tolerated while seeds land, so the 5-seed pass will not trip it. Measured rows land in ~/repos/scale_out_nsdi/mock_data as frozen1m_*_rows.csv beside their frozengen_* counterparts, incrementally as cells complete.
  STANDING: the eval session no longer pauses for confirmations it can decide; it fixes and restarts defects itself and raises only what would change what the paper CLAIMS.
- ACCELERATION BLOCK RESTARTED, IN TANDEM WITH REGIONS (Tyler: "we should just get the acceleration block to work"; "make it realistic driving behavior, where there is braking and acceleration"; "really need to work both of these in tandem"). THEY ARE ONE EXPERIMENT: fig_regions has two panels, constant-speed vehicle and vehicle that changes speed, and the SECOND PANEL IS THE ACCELERATION BLOCK. Same sweep, runner, lander, figure.
  APPROACH CHANGE: stop hand-placing one constant-acceleration event. Make the oncoming DRIVE - braking and acceleration - so CV is wrong continuously instead of at one threaded instant. Cleanest mechanism is composition, not a new controller: a slow LEAD vehicle ahead of the oncoming, whose car-following brakes it then accelerates it away. That is §2.3's queue-tail case, the paper's own motivating scenario, so nothing synthetic for a reviewer to object to. Hard constraint: endogenous, driven by the oncoming's own situation, never by the ego's position.
  THIS LIKELY REMOVES THE BOUNDARY MOVE. My reason for it: with the boundary ~30 m from the conflict, the vehicle cannot have crossed without being nearly at the conflict, so a CV error has no run-up to become a timing error. A continuously varying profile is wrong at short range too. Try realistic driving AT THE CURRENT GEOMETRY first; revisit placement only if the arms still tie, with numbers.
  REGIONS SPEC CORRECTED: the independent variable is VEHICLE SPEED (6 to 24 m/s) at FIXED GEOMETRY, per evaluation.tex and the secondary x-axis fig_regions draws on the top panel labelled "vehicle speed (m/s)" from the sweep keys. The eval session's notes had a 7-SHIFT sweep, which would make that sentence wrong and that axis meaningless. Canonical path is T25 (paper's projected marker says replace when frozen<tag>_t25_rows.csv lands; khonsu_t25_land.py is the lander; T25 is already the speed sweep, the one whose speed-clobber defect was found and fixed). Do not write a fresh runner. Y is runs completed without a collision; ALSO record FDE vs ground truth on the same runs so a non-separating collision chain still yields a forecast-quality result. Arms: cold, velocity snapshot, reactive, Khonsu, ground-truth crossing trigger, paired seeds. Constant-speed panel is UNBLOCKED, start it while the driving profile is built.
- EVALUATION AUDIT for Tyler. 7 blocks fully MEASURED: canvas, kf_vs_ssm, history_depth, microbench_measured, association, faults_isolated, record_diag. 8 with measured data landed ALONGSIDE projected rows: headline, transport, trigger_pareto, trigger_rows, freshness_decisions, multiego_rows, multiego_handoffs, topmode. 13 with NO measured backing: regions + regions_geometry (RQ2/RQ3 core), alternatives (RQ3 headline cost-vs-success), corridor_timeline + corridor_crossings (RQ4), overlap, sizing, capacity, loaded, faults, freshness_sweep, dualpub, conflict_distance (motivation, projected by design). Largest gap is corridor + regions, which together carry RQ3 and RQ4.
- ANOTHER UNTRACKED-RUNNER GAP: atlas_tail.sh and cetus_1k_tail.sh exist NOWHERE in the repo (only on the hosts) and they are the campaign runners that produced the measured headline data. Same defect class as the corridor block. Ordered copied into scripts/ and committed with the regions block.
- MANEUVERING PANEL WORK STOPPED. Tyler: "this should be straightforward... it seems more like you can't get things to actually vary, which is surprising, but not a result." He is right and I chased a panel the paper does not need. MY ERROR: I treated the closed-loop maneuvering collision as the thing the record-depth claim rests on. It is not.
  WHAT THE PAPER ACTUALLY HAS, measured: the closed-loop record ablation already separates hugely. nothing 1/10, latest box without velocity 2/10, ONE FRAME WITH VELOCITY 9/10, two frames 10/10, full record 20/20. The large effect is carrying VELOCITY AT ALL. And evaluation.tex already states the knee is at TWO frames and that closed-loop differences above one frame are "within the run-to-run variation of this small ablation" - it does NOT claim a ten-frame closed-loop requirement.
  THE MANEUVERING EVIDENCE IS THE OFFLINE FORCED HANDOFF, not a collision: one-step error 3 to 8x larger with one frame than the full history across four maneuvers; straight goes 0.250 (nothing) / 0.205 (one frame) / 0.009 (two frames) / 0.027 (ten). Measured, works, already in the paper.
  WHY ONE-VS-TEN CANNOT VARY IN CLOSED LOOP: at constant speed a velocity is exactly right, and the only window where extra depth could matter is the ~0.5 s before the destination's own tracker has its own ten frames. That window is real but too narrow to host a collision chain.
  COST OF MY ERROR: a 12-cell geometry probe, a 4-cell low-accel probe, a 3-position onset sweep, and most of a boundary retune. Ordered instead: land scenario_1_1l.py + atlas_maneuver_panel.sh into freeze_1m_overlay now (the paired seed should not stay unversioned), then resume the freeze-1m campaign in planned order starting with the regions blocks.
  OPEN FOR TYLER: the projected acceleration block (Ac* macros, warm 8/10 vs velocity snapshot 1/10) has no measured backing and we cannot produce it in this scenario. Dropping a panel is his call.
- MANEUVERING on245_kf VOID (blind GO), and the onset sweep is dead. kf COLLIDED (episodes=1, min_ttc=0.15) but the gate logged cid=-1 meet_spd=None clear=inf: it went because the oncoming was NOT VISIBLE at the decision, not because a CV forecast misled it. A collision from an invisible vehicle is not evidence a velocity snapshot is insufficient. STANDING FILTER ORDERED: any cell whose gate logs cid=-1 at the decision is void regardless of outcome, every arm.
  Mechanism: crossing tick (204) is set by the oncoming's spawn (x=200) and cruise (5 m/s), both fixed across the onset sweep; ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET only moves where acceleration begins, and 245/235/225 all sit ahead of where the oncoming already is at the decision (x~229), so none move the crossing before the decision. At the decision the oncoming was ~49 m out, pre-onset, crossing 3.7 s AFTER the decision and delivery 3.85 s after.
  SECOND CONSTRAINT neither of us was enforcing, and it is why stretching time-available kept failing: the migrated record is TEN FRAMES = 0.5 s, so if time-available is 2-3 s the destination has 40-60 of its OWN frames by the decision and the migrated history is irrelevant; the arms tie however good the geometry looks. The interesting operating point is SHORT time-available, which is exactly the regions claim (prepared state matters when the time after the crossing is short).
  GEOMETRY CALL: move the BOUNDARY, not the conflict and not the spawn alone. Moving the conflict changes the ego route/timeline and breaks comparability with other blocks; the boundary is a scenario parameter §2.3 already discusses (midpoints, shifted in 25 m steps), and ~45 m from a conflict is squarely the case the paper motivates (most traffic conflicts within 50 m of a boundary). Targets: boundary-to-conflict ~45 m (from ~30); crossing ~0.75 s (15 ticks) before the decision; onset ~0.5 s before the crossing. Cruise 5, a=2, cap 16, conflict and ego trigger untouched. Expected at the decision: ~40 m out at ~7.5 m/s, CV projects ~5.3 s to arrival vs ~3.6 s true, a 1.7 s gap to flip the gate. First cell must report those four measured numbers PLUS the gate cid and meet_spd proving it was not blind.
  EXIT: if 45 m of run-up still cannot give a seen, slow, accelerating vehicle at the decision, the two-locale scenario cannot host the panel and it moves to the corridor, where the geometry is ours to choose.
- REPRODUCIBILITY AUDIT (develop f1265216, 4f469252). Triggered by the gen_kf_vs_ssm defect below, and it found something larger. THE ENTIRE CORRIDOR BLOCK WAS UNTRACKED, not dirty but absent from the repo: ecav/scenario_testing/scenarios/scenario_1_corridor.py, scenario_1_corridor.xml, scenario_1_dense.xml, config_yaml/openscenario_1_corridor_gt.yaml, scripts/khonsu_corridor_land.py. That block drives FIVE paper artifacts (fig_alternatives, tab_corridor, fig_corridor_route timeline, fig_corridor_crossings, fig_summary) and is the metropolitan test the evaluation is built around. All five files last touched Sep 8, so settled, py_compile clean, now committed. Also committed four session records written but never staged (Aug 18/22/25/27).
  SANDBOX now has no untracked non-model files and no dirty paths. PAPER REPO verified clean by the same test: all 23 CSVs named by the plot_figures registry exist on disk AND are tracked, no untracked non-build files.
  PATTERN: code written to produce paper data never got staged because it worked first time and nobody went back for it. Rule going forward: commit a lander or scenario WITH its block, not after it. Still to land: scenario_1_1l.py into freeze_1m_overlay and atlas_maneuver_panel.sh, both when the maneuvering scenario finalizes.
- PROVENANCE DEFECT FOUND AND CLOSED (develop 2ca8fb46). scripts/gen_kf_vs_ssm.py, the generator behind the paper's Kalman-vs-state-space figure (Fig 4) and Table 6, had a substantive UNCOMMITTED working-tree edit: velocity-seeded KF init (x[7:10] from the first two detections' displacement, mirroring the closed-loop snapshot arm restoring the source KF's x[7:10]) plus skipping frame 1 as a circular prediction (the seed was computed from the 0->1 displacement) and skipping the SSM's frame-1 birth transient, plus a wider summary window. The COMMITTED version initialised the filter at zero velocity. evaluation.tex:178-179 states the seeded behaviour as fact ("the filter's velocity is seeded from the first two detections, as the closed-loop snapshot method is seeded from the migrated velocity") and plot_figures.py:250 repeats it, so the generator that produced the published numbers existed only as an uncommitted diff in one working tree. Same defect class as the overlay, but on a figure ALREADY IN THE PAPER. Surfaced by the eval session mentioning in passing that it had left the file untouched.
  HABIT: a dirty path in the sandbox tree is a provenance risk, not untidiness, because the paper's generators live there. Check whether the paper depends on a file before stepping past it.
- APPLY.SH HAZARDS FIXED (develop 4082bfab): apply refuses when any of the eleven mapped base paths is dirty in the working tree or index, checking all up front so it never partially overlays; restore does `git checkout 71c9f37e -- <path>`, pinning the frozen base regardless of what the tree sits on.
- FREEZE-1M OVERLAY REPRODUCIBLE (develop 021aeb88 + 18f103ee). Eleven settled non-scenario files under freeze_1m_overlay/ with a README naming the frozen base 71c9f37e and mapping every overlay to its base path, plus apply.sh (apply|restore) packaging the cp-then-checkout the probe scripts use. I verified independently: all eleven committed files are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the live scratchpad copies, and all eleven base paths resolve. NOTE: the eval session's first commit was LOCAL ONLY (never pushed), which left the set on one host, the exact risk the landing was meant to remove; I pushed it. HAZARD flagged for guarding: apply.sh restore does `git checkout -- <base>`, which on this SHARED checkout discards a peer's uncommitted edits to the edge manager, factories, predictor, behavior agent, tracker files, migration files and flow runner, and restores HEAD rather than the named base. Asked for: apply refuses when any mapped path is dirty; restore uses `git checkout 71c9f37e -- <path>`. scenario_1_1l.py deliberately held (actively being edited for the onset change; committing a mid-edit snapshot is worse than waiting) and lands with the first maneuvering cell, its MAP line commented ready. Post-deadline: per-fix merge into the base source files so develop is not left carrying the bugs.
- ADVISOR QUESTION ANSWERED IN THE PAPER (b342bbf). The deck's boundary-placement slide carries an advisor comment whose third point the paper never answered: "If you don't have an RSU in every single locale, then is this necessary?" Pieces existed across three sections but were never connected. New "Roadside deployment" paragraph in limitations.tex after "Hardware and locale size": the design requires sensing that spans the boundary zone, not an RSU per locale; where RSUs are sparse the serving edge draws more of its view from the vehicles, so the destination holds LESS of its own observation history and the migrated record carries MORE of the forecast (sparse deployment strengthens the case, it does not weaken it); a thinner deployment does little to lift the size bound because the fusion grid covers the road region whether or not an RSU sits on it, although fewer contributors do lower fusion cost somewhat. That hedge is grounded in motivation.tex:8-11, which states fusion cost grows with spatial extent EVEN WITH contributor count fixed because the BEV grid scales with the road region; that is a better grounding than my original "vehicles dominate the contributor count" reasoning. 25/24 pp unchanged, rules 282/282.
- HEADLINE ORDERING IS CLEAN; the headline result STANDS. Checked on existing logs (flow 12 m/s), last oncoming crossing / last first_use / ego launch: hl_warm_r1 257/267/390, hl_warm_r2 257/275/275, hl_kf_r1 257/277/435, hl_handoversnap_r1 258/271/400, fa_one_frame_r1 257/273/270, fa_hist2_r1 257/273/445, fa_hist5_r1 257/267/390. Launch is at or after delivery, mostly by 100+ ticks, so the ego HAS the migrated forecast when it gates. The two marginal cells are the ego launching into the gap as the LAST stream vehicle clears; it gated against earlier vehicles delivered ~100 ticks before. Opposite of the maneuvering cells (launch 135, delivery 143-173).
  So the record-depth null (one frame == ten frames) is PHYSICS, not a defect: at a constant 12 m/s the constant-velocity forecast equals the full forecast, and depth carries no information when there is no acceleration to capture. Constant speed cannot separate depth by construction. The record-depth-above-one-frame claim therefore genuinely rests on the maneuvering panel, which is why that panel has to work. Freeze-1m plan for the headline and record blocks stands unchanged.
- DECK: PROBLEM SLIDE FRONT AND CENTRE (Tyler, paper a52240f, pushed and byte-verified). The old slide was titled "Problem", a bare category label against the deck's own point-title convention, three bullets, no visual, buried at slide 3. Now titled "Scaling past one locale discards the history right where conflicts happen" with a purpose-drawn schematic (slides/figs/make_problem_png.py -> problem_schematic.png, 2.29 aspect so slide() uses the wide layout: bullets banded on top, figure full width below). Schematic shows two locales each with one prediction instance, the boundary on the connecting road, ten frames of observation history in the source against an empty record in the destination with "discarded at the crossing", and a conflict just past the boundary with the 50 m span. Bullets: fusion cost caps one instance near 300 m, metropolitan coverage means many locales and many boundaries, traffic puts conflicts on the connecting roads. Both advisor comments survived the rebuild (title unchanged on slide 8, and slide 3's title change does not carry a comment).
- SCENARIO ORDERING DEFECT FOUND (runway measurement, low-accel cells). The ego LAUNCHES the overtake at tick 135 in every cell, but the oncoming's boundary crossing is 138-166 and first_use (destination first holds a forecast for it) is 143-173. The ego commits BEFORE the oncoming enters its locale. No handoff design can gate a decision that has already happened, which explains every null maneuvering result: both arms complete regardless of a because the slow oncoming is not a factor at the ego's fixed positional launch (x<=307).
  This is the two-sided window failing: the late bound (slow at the decision) forces the vehicle far back, which pushes its delivery past the ego's launch, violating the early bound (source observes and migrates the rise BEFORE the decision).
  MY STEER, against the eval session's proposal: do NOT move the conflict first. The quantity to change is time available = ego decision - oncoming crossing, which is the axis the regions figure ALREADY sweeps ("time available between the crossing and the conflict, set by geometry and speed"); the maneuvering panel is one operating point on it. Moving the conflict changes the ego's route and timeline and breaks comparability with every other block. Make the ONCOMING cross earlier instead (start it closer to the boundary or trigger it earlier): the shift needed is ~1.6 s of its travel, under 10 m at a 5 m/s cruise, and it leaves the ego's route, conflict and launch position untouched.
  TARGETS: time available ~1.5 s (30 ticks); accel onset ~0.5 s before the crossing so the source records 10 frames of the rise; a=2 not 3 with cruise 5 and cap 16, which leaves the vehicle at 9 m/s at the decision (CV low enough to say GO) while the arms still separate by >20 m over the 5 s horizon. First cell must report whether the velocity-snapshot arm actually says GO, and the oncoming's distance to the conflict at the decision, so the CV projection can be checked against true arrival by hand.
  ORDERED IN PARALLEL, higher priority: extract the same four ticks (prepare, crossing, first_use, decision) from the EXISTING headline and record-ablation logs. If the ego also decides at or before first_use there, that explains the unexplained result that one-frame snapshot arms complete identically to the ten-frame arm: record depth cannot matter to a decision made before the destination publishes, and the measured separation is velocity-carrying arms vs nothing-carrying arms, weaker than the paper claims. Stop everything and report if so.
  REPRODUCIBILITY: the eval session confirmed the ENTIRE freeze-1m code set is uncommitted, living only as an Atlas scratchpad overlay (scenario_1_1l.py) applied by cp + trap-restore at runtime. Ordered: land the non-scenario fixes (coast, ghost filter, accel consumption, paired seed) on develop NOW with explicit pathspecs; the scenario lands separately once finalized.
- MANEUVERING PANEL IS ACHIEVABLE; my "ruled out" call was WRONG and Tyler corrected it. The knob we were varying was the wrong one. In scenario_1_corridor.py the ONCOMING_ACCEL branch starts ConstantAccelWaypointFollower immediately after trigger_behavior, and trigger_behavior is InTriggerDistanceToLocation on the EGO at TRIGGER_DIST=300, so the oncoming accelerates for the whole 300 m ego approach and is at ONCOMING_VCAP long before the decision at any a. Lowering a only changes the ride time to the cap.
  The panel does not need "still accelerating at the decision", it needs SLOW at the decision AND accelerating through it: only then does the CV read say GO while the truth arrives early. At 14 m/s and rising, CV still says WAIT, which is every cell we ran.
  FIX ORDERED: slow-cruise phase first, ended by the ONCOMING actor's OWN route position, then constant acceleration. The structure already exists in the ONCOMING_STEP branch; copy it with InTriggerDistanceToLocation keyed on `actor` not `self.ego_vehicles[0]` (ego keying was the only thing that made the old step exogenous), handing into ConstantAccelWaypointFollower with the cruise speed as start speed instead of a jump to 16. New knobs ONCOMING_CRUISE (default 5) and ONCOMING_ACCEL_ONSET; ONCOMING_STEP stays quarantined as the exogenous control. Onset placed just before the oncoming crosses the boundary so the source locale observes the first frames of the rise.
  ARITHMETIC: cruise 5, a=3, 60 m to conflict at the decision -> CV projects 12 s to arrival, truth arrives ~5 s even with the 16 m/s cap. Large, not marginal.
  NOT manufactured: a vehicle departing a stop line, queue tail, or completed turn and accelerating to cruise is exactly the case CV is wrong about, and §2.3 already names queue tails and stopped vehicles as traffic-generated conflicts. Manufactured would be an unphysical a or an ego-keyed trigger. Bounds: cruise 4-6, a 2-3, cap 16. Scenario change => whole maneuvering block reruns; no capped spawn-onset run mixes in.
- SUPERSEDED, kept for the record: MANEUVERING PANEL, closed loop ruled out. 12-cell geometry probe: at a=5 the oncoming reaches the 16 m/s cap before the ego decides in every cell (rise takes 2.4 s from v0=4 against a ~4 s runway), so the CV read is correct at ~15.6 m/s, both arms WAIT, no separation and no collision. Eval session proposed framing the panel on the UNCAPPED accel scenario (warm 60.4 vs kf 25.9 m/s); I REJECTED it: 60.4 m/s is 217 km/h, an unbounded constant-accel extrapolation, so the spread measures the extrapolation, not forecast quality, and against ground truth the warm arm is wrong in the other direction. Ordered instead a 4-cell probe at a in {1.5,2,2.5,3}, v0=4, shift -40, cap kept, with an explicit still-accelerating-at-the-decision boolean and FDE against GROUND TRUTH per arm. Exit if no cell is still accelerating: the honest negative is that at realistic accelerations this geometry has the vehicle at its cap by the decision, the maneuvering evidence rests on the offline Kalman-vs-state-space microbenchmark, and the regions claim is qualified to the velocity snapshot being sufficient across the whole constructible closed-loop range.
- CONFLICT FIGURE NEEDS DENSITY (Tyler, Sep 10): "the graph where we show the number of conflicts, we need to show vehicle density here, otherwise the point is moot". Correct: the figure shows WHERE conflicts fall relative to boundaries over an unstated amount of traffic, so the 54%-within-50 m cannot be read as busy, quiet, or an artifact of how many conflicts occurred; fixed conflicts are geometry and density-independent, traffic-generated ones are a function of density. Ordered: density column + per-map exposure (road length, observation duration) in conflict_distance.csv with schema and status updated; generated rows across >= 3 density levels spanning §5.7's traffic levels; TWO-PANEL figure (left: the existing CDF with one traffic curve per density level, showing the shape is stable while the count is not; right: boundary-adjacent conflicts per unit road per hour against density, with fixed conflicts as a flat reference), one column, under 250 pt; §2.3 gains the rate statement through macros (fixed count set by layout, traffic-generated count set by density, which is why placement cannot solve it), still projected; rules = fixed rate flat across density, traffic rate strictly increasing, within-50 m FRACTION stable while the COUNT is not.
- FRAMING RESET LANDED (fork 775b862): abstract opens on the scale problem at 194 words (existing systems serve one bounded region; enlarging it to metropolitan scale breaks the edge deadline because fusion cost grows with road area; coverage divides into locales, which puts boundaries on roads where traffic creates conflicts); intro gained the state-of-the-art-stops-here paragraph before the central question and the two-requirement sentence (enough state, and in time); canvas paragraph and caption lead with the budget being exceeded, with a PENDING note that the plotted quantity is fusion latency and an end-to-end sweep would need new data; RQ1 reworded. VELOCITY SNAPSHOT rename: 25 sites (8 prose/caption, 9 plot-script label sites, 2 in the old float script, 6 generated table rows); zero "Kalman snapshot" in the rendered build, 23 "velocity snapshot"; three figures changed content (regions, alternatives, corridor crossings); Kalman now names only the offline filter, the Kalman backend in §4 and the bytes table, and the design schema row reads filter state. Consistency fixes all in: current owning locale, the source-bound CAV sentence (source serves its own bound vehicles from its local track until the tracker drops the road user; no CAV sees two owners' streams), 1.25 KB per track, the two-second sentence scoped to the ten-frame predictor input with the destination forecasting meanwhile, Singer/IMM as classical maneuvering-target models, ownership over tracks with forecasts published, conclusion ends on recipient CAVs needing the forecast. Pages 25/24.
- FRAMING RESET (Kishore via Tyler, Sep 10): the LEAD STORY IS SCALE-OUT, not handoff. Chain to carry everywhere: Conductor makes cooperative prediction work inside one bounded locale; city-scale coverage needs more road area than one locale can serve; naively enlarging the locale breaks the edge deadline because fusion cost grows with area; splitting into locales restores feasibility but creates boundary crossings where prediction state must stay continuous; Khonsu solves that continuity problem. "Khonsu is not motivated by migration; it is motivated by scaling cooperative prediction from one locale to many." Paper edits ordered: abstract first paragraph names the scale problem; intro gains a state-of-the-art-stops-here paragraph (single-region systems do not preserve track history across independently served regions; edge migration moves service state, not prediction state tied to trajectories and planner age limits); Figure 1 caption says naively enlarging one locale exceeds the 130 ms budget (data unchanged; end-to-end compute would need new data, PENDING if so); RQ1 rewords to where one locale stops scaling and what scale-out problem appears next. Deck: first five slides become Conductor one locale / metropolitan goal / enlarged locale misses the deadline / state-of-the-art gap / therefore split and the boundary problem. PLUS reviewer consistency fixes: track has one current owning locale (not belongs); one precise sentence on what a source-bound CAV receives after ownership moves (delivery is by binding; the source keeps serving its own bound vehicles from its local track until its tracker drops the road user; no CAV sees two owners' streams); 1.25 KB per track not per vehicle; the two-second sentence scoped to rebuilding the full ten-frame predictor input; RENAME the closed-loop baseline Kalman snapshot -> VELOCITY SNAPSHOT everywhere (reserving Kalman filter for the offline Figure 4 comparison, since no closed-loop arm runs a filter); §6 Singer/IMM wording (classical maneuvering-target models, not recent state-space trackers) and owned/published phrasing (a track is owned, a forecast is published); conclusion "the answer" -> "recipient CAVs need its forecast"; and one sentence late in the intro surfacing the paper's decomposition (enough state, and in time). Then stop adding evidence to the body.
- ACCEL CONSUMPTION FIX CONFIRMED, OPERATING POINT WRONG: warm's gate_accel is now consistent (used 5.96 every decision, src=migrated then a logged handover to local) where it previously flickered none/local/migrated by timing; migrated and local estimates agree at 5.96, so the fix buys RELIABILITY not a different number; kf src=none. But at shift -40 BOTH arms WAIT and neither separates: by the time kf locally detects the oncoming it has already accelerated to ~25.9 m/s over the long runway from the far-west spawn, so kf's constant-velocity gate on that high CURRENT speed is itself conservative and correctly waits. The panel's premise needs kf to see the vehicle while SLOW so its CV underestimates the arrival. WRITING SESSION STEER: sweep INITIAL SPEED as the primary lever (about 4, 6, 8 m/s at a=5) with shift secondary (two or three shifts where the ego gates the vehicle at all), reporting per cell the oncoming speed at the decision, its speed at the conflict, the gate decision per arm, and the outcome; the target operating point has the vehicle at roughly a third to a half of its conflict speed at the decision, so a constant-velocity reading is wrong for a recognisable physical reason (a vehicle pulling away from a queue or merging) rather than because the geometry hid it. Shift alone changes WHEN the ego sees the vehicle rather than what the vehicle is doing, and pushed far it becomes a late-appearance scenario, a different claim; delayed acceleration onset is the exogenous step the redesign removed and stays out. Constraints: keep constant acceleration from spawn so the trend is in the transferred history, and state the chosen initial speed and acceleration in the caption. If no combination gives a slow vehicle at the decision without the geometry hiding it, the maneuvering panel takes the forecast-quality result rather than a manufactured collision.
- VELOCITY CHECK CLEAN (eval session): the gate reads obs.kf_speed_mps directly (behavior_agent:1191) and the edge coast-seeding sets that field from _migrated_vel_mps during the blind window, so the gate consumes the TRANSFERRED velocity; after local re-detection factories clears the migrated value and the local KF stands (natural handover). The one position-diff speed re-estimate (behavior_agent:879) is inside the emergency-brake backstop and operates on the published forecast, so it is consistent, not a hidden re-derivation. Acceleration was the only re-derived quantity. ACCEL FIX being implemented with the three conditions plus a per-track _n_local_since_import counter (local frames since import, distinct from memo_bank length) and a [GATE_ACCEL] line logging used/src/migrated/local_est/n_local per decision with the handover tick. SEED CHECK PASSED: pairing exact (warm-s1 and kf-s1 both draw -2.925 m); band 4 m gives offsets -2.925/+3.648/-2.096 across seeds 1/2/3 with crossing_tick 262/251/260, ~0.55 s of geometry spread, correct direction; the check's "-5 s blind" T_avail was a wrong-cid artifact of the check script (tail -1 took the last handoff, not the gating one), not a scenario problem, and the panel's lander keys on the gating cid. OPEN QUESTION for the write-up: the eval session notes the natural dec_arr run-to-run noise (110-140 ticks, ~1.5 s) already DOMINATES the 4 m seed band, so most interval width may be simulator timing jitter rather than the situational sampling just added; ordered to decompose the two from the panel runs (spread across seeds at fixed shift vs spread across repetitions at the same seed) and either widen the band until the situational component dominates (preferred, if the operating point stays in regime) or state the composition plainly in the methodology.
- THIRD RE-DERIVATION DEFECT FOUND (eval session, holding the panel): warm's erratic margins are NOT seed luck. Per accel at shift -40: a=4 warm gate accel_src=none -> GO (did not see the acceleration, 0.1 s miss); a=6 warm accel_src=LOCAL -> WAIT then GO (0.1 s miss); a=5 warm never gated the oncoming (cid=-1) and was comfortable by luck (1.60 s). ROOT CAUSE: factories DOES set t._migrated_accel_mps2 from the migrated frames, but the gate never uses it: edge_manager sets gate_accel to a LOCAL per-tick re-estimate of the current memo_bank and only LABELS accel_src='migrated' when that local estimate happens to match the migrated value within 0.5. So warm's acceleration awareness is timing-dependent local re-estimation, not a read of the transferred value; averaging 20 seeds would have smoothed a broken consumption path into "warm is somewhat better". SAME DEFECT CLASS as the maturity bug: the record carries the value and the consumer re-derives it locally, so migration is inert for the thing it transferred. FIX APPROVED (writing session) with three conditions: use the transferred acceleration directly as gate_accel while the destination has fewer than the threshold of its own frames, then hand over to the local estimate with the handover point logged; keep logging the local re-estimate BESIDE the value actually used so divergence is visible; accel_src names what the gate USED (migrated/local/none), not what it matched. Also ordered: grep the gate and planner paths for any other locally re-estimated quantity the record also carries, especially VELOCITY, since if the gate re-estimates speed the same way then the constant-velocity arms are not consuming what they were sent either and the whole comparison rests on local re-derivation; report even if nothing. Then re-check at a=4 and 5, then the panel.
- ACCEL-MAG PROBE RESULT (a 4/5/6 x warm/kf at shift -40, single seed): NO collision at any level (episodes 0 everywhere), so magnitude is not a deterministic lever; but not "comfortable for both" either. At a=5: warm min TTC 1.60 s with zero ticks under 0.3 s (accel-aware gate, safe timing); kf min TTC 0.05 s with 15 ticks under 0.3 s (accel_src=none, GO on constant velocity, razor-thin near-miss). Single-seed margins are erratic across accel (warm 0.1 / 1.60 / 0.1 at a=4/5/6; kf ~0.05 throughout), so the panel must be a SUCCESS RATE over paired seeds: kf's thin margin tips to a collision on some seeds while warm's does not. WRITING SESSION RULING: build the panel as THREE shifts around -40 at a=5 x warm/kf x 20 paired seeds, not a single operating point (one point cannot distinguish mechanism from cell; three points show the separation opening as available time shortens, which is the paper's claim, and protect against mis-placement once the seed band moves T_avail); prefer a=4 if it separates on the seed spread, state the level in the caption. CAUTION: warm's own 0.1 s margins at a=4 and 6 mean warm is erratic too, so the a=5 comfort may be luck; report the FULL min-TTC distribution for both arms, not the mean, and check whether warm's thin cells came from a different decision (go, or wait then meet late); if warm is thin at some accelerations for a non-seed reason, that goes in the caption rather than being averaged away.
- CORRECTION (eval session): warm DID WAIT at the a=3.0 decision (accel_src=migrated, meet_spd 31.7, clear 42 -> WAIT); the earlier "both GO" reading came from a tail -1 catching the post-pass GO line. So warm != kf AT THE DECISION already at mild acceleration: warm waits seeing the accel, kf goes on constant velocity. Only the OUTCOME flip is missing. WRITING SESSION: add completion time and completed/not to every probe cell beside the decision line and closest approach, because waiting has a cost: if warm waits while kf goes and gets away with it, the honest reading at mild acceleration is that the conservative choice costs time and the aggressive one is lucky, which is weaker than the paper's claim. The test is whether kf's margin is THIN across seeds (0.3 s on one seed, collision on another = the panel) or comfortable (2 s every time = no amount of acceleration makes waiting right). With the paired seed in place a thin-margin operating point yields a spread of outcomes and the panel becomes a success RATE rather than a deterministic pass or fail, which is the better figure. PAIRED SEED BUILT: KHONSU_SEED index -> random.Random(seed).uniform(-band, band) offset on the oncoming stream spawn x, on top of ONCOMING_SHIFT_X, deterministic per index so seed k is identical across arms; seed 0 or unset = 0 (backward compatible); band KHONSU_SEED_BAND_M default 4 m; [SEEDROW] logs seed_idx, band, spawn_offset, eff_shift per run for the caption. Check queued (seeds 1/2/3 warm + seed 1 kf, flow shift 0, const 12) verifying pairing and that the band moves T_avail without flipping the regime; writing session asked for the realised T_avail PER SEED (not only the spread) and confirmation the offset applies to the whole stream rather than one vehicle.
- MANEUVERING SMOKE DEGENERATE, RE-MAPPED (first-run check earned its keep): at shift -17 under a=3.0 both arms gate on cid=-1 clear=inf (the accelerating oncoming had already crossed and passed before the ego decided), because the const-12 shift->T_avail mapping does not hold under acceleration (crossing tick 93 vs ~115; oncoming reaches 21-23 m/s). Fix confirmed inside the campaign though: warm CVMIGRATED=0 with a 10-frame seam, kf CVMIGRATED=1 with 1 frame, identity instrument live. Accel re-map at shifts -10..-70: at -25/-40/-55 warm's gate reads accel_src=migrated with meet_spd 23.6/31.7/33.7 m/s while kf reads accel_src=none, so warm != kf AT THE FORECAST LEVEL (the coast + gate fix payoff, measured). NO OUTCOME separation at a=3.0: every cell both arms GO with episodes 0. Writing session ruling: run the {4,5,6} probe at shift -40 but report per cell and arm the gate's computed gap and arrival time, meet speed, go/wait, and closest approach; if kf goes and still completes with ~2 s of margin, magnitude is not the lever and the geometry is (move the decision point closer to the conflict), because a panel that separates only at 6 m/s^2 is about an extreme rather than the mechanism.
- SEEDS QUESTION RAISED (writing session, before the sweep launches): the eval session reports the runner has NO seed env var, so "10 seeds" = 10 repeated runs varying only by CARLA non-determinism. The paper says otherwise in at least five places (params table "Seeds, two-locale methods 10 to 20", "Seeds, corridor methods 20 per traffic level", "twenty runs per point with Wilson 95% intervals" at :337, "paired seeds at each of two traffic levels" :698, "bootstrap 95% across seeds, taking the seed as the statistical unit" :757, "Ten paired seeds per point" :765). Repetitions under timing jitter measure run-to-run variability of ONE scenario instance, not variability across scenarios, which is what a Wilson or bootstrap interval over "seeds" implies. Asked: what actually varies between repetitions, whether any scenario randomness exists (spawn timing, initial speeds, traffic composition, spacing), and whether the runner can take a seed that varies it. Resolution: either add a scenario-perturbing seed (preferred, cheap, and the corridor and headline blocks make the same claim) so the intervals mean what the paper says, or rename them repetitions under simulator timing jitter everywhere and describe the intervals as run-to-run spread. MANEUVERING PANEL: single accel level, not crossed with the shift axis (35 cells would be unattributable); pick the LOWEST commanded level at which warm and kf diverge at the mid-transition shift, stated in the caption; the accel-magnitude sweep stays as the estimator validation.
- ROUND-TRIP RELAY SMOKE PASSED (both directions filtered, CARLA untouched): commit_ms 0.98 / 6.71 / 40.78 / 100.75 at one-way 0 / 3 / 20 / 50 ms = 2x the one-way delay, exactly the prepare-plus-acknowledge cost the lead budget spends; prepare_ms 1.07 / 8.83 / 54.39 / 134.45 (higher: payload RPC, HTTP/2 framing, first-transfer connection setup at 19/121/301 ms). Six XFERROW per run, zero fallbacks, every run completed; the 50 ms round trip did NOT break scenario timing, so the sweep keeps its full 0-50 ms range. Transport audit defect fully closed. CAMPAIGN GATE CLEAR; launching the maneuvering sweep first (7 shifts x 10 seeds x arms, fixed overlay, identity-settling columns via factories stamping the exported cid and [MIG_IDENT] per pass). Writing session asked that the first-run check include the identity columns (empty settling record or never-matching identity = broken instrument, catch it at run three not seventy) and one line per arm on whether the imported track went mature at commit, so the fix is confirmed inside the campaign and not only in the smoke.
- RELAY SMOKE PASSED (measured, first genuine transport numbers in the project): delay 0/3/20/50 ms -> commit_ms 0.43/3.63/20.92/50.71, prepare_ms 1.14/4.91/27.72/67.77, six [XFERROW] per run, ZERO fallbacks, runs clean (episodes 0, 3 handoffs each). Transfer time tracks the wire; commit is the clean line (~1x one-way + ~0.5 ms base); prepare runs higher (payload RPC + framing + first-transfer connection setup). The smoke used a PORT-FILTERED netem on egress to dport 50771 only, so the sweep measured one-way delay; WRITING SESSION RULING: add the response-direction filter (sport 50771) and re-run the four cells so the sweep is ROUND TRIP, because the paper cites a one-way inter-site fibre latency and the lead budget spends a round trip; a request-only delay understates the protocol cost by half and would make the figure axis mean something other than the cited numbers. If the round trip breaks scenario timing at 50 ms, report rather than revert and the paper states the tolerated range. ALL THREE PRE-CAMPAIGN ITEMS CLOSED (Defect A cadence, shift mapping signed off, relay smoke passed); campaign ordered to launch after the round-trip re-run, with identity-settling columns and identity-keyed landers folded in, block order regions-feeding blocks first (maneuvering sweep is the must-be-clean result), then headline and record, then the loaded pair, then corridor and tail, each block reported with rule scores as it lands. STANDING INSTRUCTION: stop and report any block whose first runs look degenerate rather than letting it complete.
- RELAY SMOKE UP AND CARRYING TRAFFIC (readiness passed; relay.log shows PREPARE/COMMIT RPCs in the d=0 cell), so the transport audit fix is validated; netem cells 3/20/50 ms follow (port-filtered on dport 50771 so CARLA is undelayed). MANEUVERING SHIFT SET APPROVED: crossing = 85.9 - 1.69*shift, decision arrival shift-independent at ~124-125 ticks, so T_avail(shift) = 1.95 + 0.085*shift. Set = shift 0 (1.95 s, delivered ANCHOR, added by the writing session so the plateau is visible rather than assumed), -5 (1.53), -11 (1.02), -17 (0.52), -22 (0.10, at the boundary), -26 (-0.24, blind), -30 (-0.58, blind): seven points. Predicted values are nominal; the lander computes x per run from that run's own EGO-DBG first tick at x<=307 and HANDOFFROW crossing_tick, never the per-shift nominal (confirmed by design; the maneuvering lander does not exist yet so nothing currently mis-assigns). NOTE: dec_arr spread (110-140 in the probe) is comparable to the spacing between adjacent boundary shifts, so measured points will interleave; keep ten seeds per shift and do not trim that block, and report the realised T_avail per shift when the sweep lands.
- FIXED-OVERLAY SHIFT MAPPING LANDED + SIGNED OFF (Atlas, coast + ghost fixes, shifts {10,0,-10,-18,-26} x {warm,kf}, constant 12): commit->first_use fell from ~23 ticks (pre-fix 24/23/22/21/23) to ~5 (6/5/6/5/3), so the blind/delivered boundary moved from ~1.15 s of available time (set by local re-detection under the coasting-prune defect) to ~0-0.25 s (set by commit + ~1.25-cycle delivery): a ~0.9 s improvement, the fix's measured payoff and worth a paper sentence. Outcome episodes 0 in every cell for both arms, consistent with velocity-vs-nothing at constant velocity. CONSEQUENCE: the five shifts were chosen to bracket a cliff at 0.65-1.15 s and now sit almost entirely in the delivered region, so the maneuvering panel would be flat; a NEW SHIFT SET is needed bracketing the new boundary (several points between ~1.5 s and ~0.5 s where reactive and the snapshot arms differ, plus at least two at or below zero where even Khonsu goes blind), re-picked from the crossing-tick vs shift regression and signed off before the sweep. Also: the panel's x value must be computed per run from that run's own ticks (dec_arr has single-seed noise; the -18/-26 warm inversion is a dec_arr artifact), confirm the lander does; no extra boundary seeds. Stale pre-fix mapping preserved (cetus /tmp/cetus_1m_probe_report.txt) as the old-boundary record for an appendix contrast. Next: relay smoke, with the new shift set proposed while it runs.
- LEAD CONSTANT REVERTED (eval session, KB d293c263): runner_wired.py back to _fold_s = 3 * 0.2 in computed (:644), mtr (:595), oracle (:612); no code behaviour change before the rerun. The measured ~2-cycle commit-to-first-use is derivable from existing HANDOFFROW columns, so the rerun supplies it across hundreds of handoffs; identity-settling columns still to be added. SHIFT MAPPING TO BE RE-DERIVED ON THE FIXED OVERLAY (writing session): the cetus probe ran on the pre-fix /tmp/m_stage overlay, so its axis (shift -> T_avail = decision arrival minus crossing) carries over (geometry + ego approach) but its blind/delivered boundary is a DIFFERENT MECHANISM now: pre-fix the boundary was set by local re-detection because no migrated forecast existed in the blind window; post-fix it is set by commit plus the two-cycle delivery, and the maneuvering panel's shortest points sit exactly there. Probe cells re-run on the fixed overlay, mapping reported with both quantities per shift, signed off then. The stale probe output is KEPT in the KB marked pre-fix: it is the only measurement of the boundary under the coasting defect and may serve an appendix contrast if the cliff moves substantially.
- LEAD CONSTANT: KEEP THREE CYCLES IN CODE (writing session ruling). The reservation is a hardcoded literal, _fold_s = 3 * 0.2 in runner_wired.py at :595 (mtr), :612 (oracle), :644 (computed); the lead is min(2.5, max(_fold_s + 0.35, xfer + _fold_s + 0.35)), so 0.95 s today and 0.75 s at two cycles. The DEFAULT predictive arm does not use it (it uses LOOKAHEAD_S), so only the computed/mtr/oracle arms carry it. The eval session had changed it to two; ORDERED REVERTED because: the constant is a design MARGIN for preparing early under load, not a measurement of import time; two cycles is the best case on the flow geometry with no contention, and §5.8 exists to measure the cases where import work spills into later cycles; the capacity figure draws this lead as a horizontal threshold, so shrinking it moves a reported threshold; and changing trigger behaviour mid-campaign invalidates comparisons for a reason unrelated to the question. PAPER EDIT INSTEAD: §4 keeps three cycles, described as a margin covering import scheduling and the first destination forecast under load, plus a sentence that the measured commit-to-first-use time on the flow geometry is about two cycles, cited from the rerun handoff rows when they land. Checked: the paper quotes no 950 ms figure; the computed lead appears only as the capacity-figure line and the trigger table arm name, both the computed arm.
- DEFECT A DOES NOT EXIST POST-FIX (eval session measurement; 1 edge cycle = 4 sim ticks): npc 199 commit 55 -> publish 56 (+1) -> first_use 61 (+5) = 6 ticks; npc 201 commit 257 -> publish 258 -> first_use 263 = 6; npc 200 commit 156 -> first_use 163 = 7. The destination publishes on the 0.2 s edge stride (MODESROW 258/262/266) and the imported track's first forecast lands ON that stride with no extra hold; the ego plans every ~5 ticks (EGO-DBG 260/265/270) and consumes at its first planning cycle after publication. No step waits for a boundary it does not need: commit -> first_use is one edge publish cycle + one ego planning cycle + phase = ~2 cycles. The old 3.25-cycle figure was the track being invisible (Defect B). RULING: no migration code change; §4's lead-time reservation goes from three 200 ms cycles to two, with the computed lead recomputed; no confirmation run (the rerun's handoff rows will confirm the two-cycle figure across hundreds of handoffs if they carry commit and first-use ticks). PENDING before the paper edit: whether the code carries a three-cycle CONSTANT (which must change before the rerun, since it alters the trigger lead) or derives the reservation, and the computed-lead value under a two-cycle reservation.
- DEFECT A MAY BE SMALLER OR ABSENT (eval session, KB ee67b32e; MIG_DBG removed, MIG_SEAM kept): the v3 verify shows first_use at commit+7/+8 on all three handoffs (first_dst_track 54/155/255 -> first_use 61/163/263), about TWO edge cycles, not the 13 ticks / 3.25 cycles measured before the coast fix; the imported track is now present and mature immediately, so the ego consumes it sooner. Plan: add MIG_COMMIT/MIG_APPLY/MIG_PUBLISH markers, measure commit->apply->publish->first_use per handoff with cycle boundaries marked, then remove only genuinely IDLE waits. WRITING SESSION RULING: two cycles may simply be the pipeline cadence (one cycle to apply and publish, one planner tick to consume, plus phase); if no step is idle, change no code and instead correct §4, whose lead-time paragraph reserves THREE 200 ms cycles for import and refresh (written against the old behaviour) - the reservation becomes two and the computed lead shrinks accordingly. Report the breakdown and the idle/not-idle judgement before changing anything. Identity-settling columns (identity_at_commit_matches_export, ticks_to_settle, settled) accepted on HANDOFFROW for the rerun; identity-keyed landers accepted for FDE, record-ablation, and headline collision diagnostics.
- DEFECT B CLOSED (v3 attributed verify, coast + ghost-filter fixes): imported track produces MTR within ~1 cycle of commit (npc 199 tid 2 first MODESROW 56 vs commit ~54; npc 201 tid 4 258 vs ~255); the earlier 80-160 tick "gap" was a metric artifact (the imported track transiently carries a MIS-ASSOCIATED carla_id, 197, for ~30 MTR rows, so filtering on the gating cid missed the early forecasts). Predictor classification is the direct evidence: warm CVMIGRATED=0 (no warm import ever entered the immature-CV branch, mature MTR on the migrated 10 frames from commit) and kf CVMIGRATED=3 (each one-frame import correctly immature), CVSWITCH=0 both = the intended record-depth split. first_use is commit+7/+8 on all three handoffs. Ghost removals 335 -> 54. RESIDUAL, now a paper item not just a lander item: the 8 m association gate binds the imported track to a NEIGHBOURING vehicle's identity for ~30 rows before settling, among closely spaced flow vehicles. Ordered: quantify it in the rerun as columns on the handoff rows (identity at commit matches the exported vehicle? ticks to settle? ever settles?), so §7's identity limitation carries a measured settling time and the appendix association figure can connect the isolated harness to live behaviour; and key the FDE lander AND the record-ablation and headline-collision landers on the TRACKLET identity, recording the resolved carla_id, so a mis-association is visible rather than silently reassigning forecasts. Remaining before the campaign: Defect A fix, shift mapping, relay smoke, in that order.
- PAPER ac646fe: the tracker name is gone from the rendered document; §4.1 now says every closed-loop arm tracks with the state-space tracker and the constant-velocity comparison is a Kalman filter in the offline forced-handoff experiment (its mean/covariance/confirmation description is now a property of that filter and supports the bytes table); §4.2 import says the implementation supports a Kalman backend that injects filter state and that no closed-loop arm uses it; §5.1 Kalman snapshot sends one frame of the observation history (latest box + difference + velocity), name kept for the tables; the depth-ablation sentences and the generated table row say "Kalman snapshot, one frame" instead of "Kalman state"; bytes table keeps the 448 B row labelled "Kalman backend record, not sent in the closed loop" with the caption stating the closed loop sends the state-space record or a one-frame slice. Design-section record schema still lists an optional model-state field that may be a tracker cache or a Kalman state (format, not usage) - left as is deliberately.
- AB3DMOT DESCRIPTION CORRECTED (eval session code answer): NO closed-loop arm runs AB3DMOT. WorldFusionMambaAdaptiveEdge.__init__ calls the shared base (which constructs AB3DMOT at edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py:209) and then OVERRIDES it with get_tracker('mamba3dmot') at line 68, so the constructed AB3DMOT never tracks anything; every closed-loop arm tracks with Mamba (mamba_dbg_rows ~1100-1200, ab3dmot_dbg_rows 0 in all six landed arms). The real filterpy Kalman filter lives only in the offline baselines used by the Kalman-vs-state-space microbenchmark. The kf arm's RECORD is a one-frame Mamba memo-bank snapshot (latest bbox + diff + time-denominated velocity, history_depth=1 for kf/edgewarp/handover_snapshot in _export_track_latent), NOT a filter mean + covariance; the KFState record (10-vector + 10x10 covariance, payload_wired.py:37-50) is built only on the AB3DMOT branch, which no Paper 3 closed-loop arm reaches. Paper corrections ordered: §4.1 AB3DMOT sentence, §5.1 "filter state" in the Kalman-snapshot definition, a decision on the bytes table's Kalman record row (a record type nothing in the closed loop sends), and a sweep for any other implication that a filter runs closed-loop; the maneuvering-panel explanation stands because the arm does extrapolate at constant velocity, only the velocity's source changes. Closed-loop numbers unchanged.
- GHOST-FILTER CHECKS ANSWERED (eval session): (a) SYMMETRY: every closed-loop arm INCLUDING kf runs the Mamba tracker (mamba_dbg_rows ~1100-1200, ab3dmot_dbg_rows = 0 in every arm); "kf" is the one-frame Kalman-SNAPSHOT migration mode, not a Kalman tracker. Ghost removals: cold 617, warm 384, kf 379, handoversnap 345, reactive 371, edgewarp 361, so kf sits in the migrating band and there is no kf-vs-Mamba filter confound; cold's higher count follows from its worse tracking, not from filter bias. (b) IDENTITY: retained. COASTROW tid 2 steps run 1..42 with no gaps and MIG_SEAM fires once, so the same tracklet object survives every removal: the filter deletes only the tracked_trajectories VIEW (rebuilt next tick), never the tracklet, so tid and memo bank persist and the record-ablation and FDE continuity are noisier but not fragmented. Nothing landed needs re-describing beyond the planned rerun. NEW PAPER QUESTION RAISED BY THIS: §4 says "We also run AB3DMOT, a Kalman-based 3D multi-object tracker, as a constant-velocity baseline. Its transferable state consists of the filter mean, covariance, and confirmation status" and §5.1 says the Kalman snapshot "sends position, velocity, and filter state", but no closed-loop arm instantiates AB3DMOT; asked the eval session whether AB3DMOT runs anywhere closed-loop or only in the offline Kalman-vs-state-space microbenchmark, and what the kf record actually carries. If it is a one-frame snapshot on the Mamba tracker, §4 and §5.1 are corrected (the results do not change, only the description of the arm).
- v2 COAST FIX WORKS AT THE SEEDING LAYER (all three handoffs now seed at the destination in warm: cid 199 tid 2, cid 200 tid 1, cid 201 tid 5, each 10 frames with real coast displacement; kf seeds 1 frame; the gating handoff finally gets an import-created track). NEW PRE-EXISTING BUG FOUND: _filter_ghost_tracks (edge_manager, runs at handler line 750 BEFORE predict at 794) builds its speed map only from self.tracker.trackers, the AB3DMOT Kalman internals; the Mamba wrapper has no .trackers, so every Mamba track reads speed 0.00, is flagged static, and is removed after 4 frames (335 GHOST FILTER removals in the warm run, 105 of them the seeded gating tid carrying ~12 m/s). Mamba tracks survived only because _ab3d_history_to_trajs recreated them each tick from local detections; in the blind window there are no local detections, so the seeded track never stabilized into MTR. This affects EVERY Mamba run in the landed campaign. FIX: fall back to the obstacle kf_speed_mps when the AB3DMOT lookup has no entry (AB3DMOT path unchanged; a parked car still reads ~0). WRITING SESSION ADDED two checks: (a) SYMMETRY: the kf arm runs the AB3DMOT tracker and may have been filtered far less than the Mamba arms, in which case landed kf-vs-Mamba comparisons (FDE table, Kalman-vs-state-space rows) partly reflect the filter and need a note until the rerun; (b) IDENTITY COST: does a removed-and-recreated track keep its tid and memo bank, or return as a fresh tid with empty history? If identity is lost, the removals fragment the per-track continuity that the record-ablation and FDE diagnostics measured, which is a stronger caveat than "noisier".
- WHAT THE MEASURED HEADLINE SEPARATION ACTUALLY IS (eval session, four independent lines from the retained logs + frozen1k_headline_diag.csv): VELOCITY-VERSUS-NOTHING. (1) Per-run provenance, 20 runs/arm, gating cid 201: cold is blind with an empty velocity estimate at commit in all 20 and collides 9/20; every migrating arm carries ~12 m/s at commit, blind 0, collides 0-2/20. (2) DECISIVE MATURITY CONTROL: handover_snapshot and kf are ONE-FRAME records and collide identically to ten-frame warm (0/20) despite 2-3x worse FDE, so the collision outcome is decoupled from record depth. (3) No mature migrated forecast exists before the decision in either arm (first destination MTR warm 348 / kf 366 vs first_use 277). (4) Warm holds a track and velocity for the gating vehicle from tick 254; cold first sees it at ~313 by local redetection; cold r1 has ZERO prediction lines, warm r1 has 36 carrying a CV/KF speed. IMPLICATION: the headline mechanism sentence stands (cold's rebuilt track under-speeds the oncoming, a migrating arm has a velocity and cold has nothing), but the record-DEPTH story above one frame rests ENTIRELY on the maneuvering panel: at constant velocity a one-frame snapshot's CV forecast is as good as warm's for the go/no-go. CONSEQUENCE FOR VERIFICATION: the constant-velocity flow verify will NOT show an outcome change from the coast fix; the fix is verified by MECHANISM (warm first destination MTR within ~1 cycle of commit, kf staying immature at one frame) and the payoff appears only in the maneuvering panel. V2 FIX BUILT: every cycle, for each imported track in tracked OR lost, rebuild ot.trajectory from the memo bank TRANSLATED to end at the coasted current pose, recreate the entry if pruned, carry migrated velocity and acceleration onto the obstacle; depth-based maturity preserved; publish gate untouched. Attributed verify launching.
- ATTRIBUTED VERIFY (frozen_1m_verify/_report.txt): warm ~= kf at the DESTINATION, so the migrated history buys nothing at the point of use. Destination first MTR for the gating cid: npc 199 warm 132 / kf 162 (local-born tids; the import-created tid 2 matures at warm 172 vs kf 174 despite 10 frames vs 1); npc 200 warm 236 / kf 266 with no import-created track; npc 201 (GATING) warm 348 / kf 366 with NO import-created destination track in either arm, every tid local-born, first_use 277 -> at the decision the ego consumes a LOCAL immature forecast and migration is INERT for the gating decision. Only 1 of 3 handoffs produced any seam. MECHANISM (code): the destination is locally blind to the oncoming until ~x=275 (~42 ticks after crossing, RSU1 range 50 m); during that window the imported track has no local detection, so _ab3d_history_to_trajs PRUNES its trajectory entry (edge ~1841-1844) and the seeding loop skips it (~1879-1882, _ot is None), so MTR only runs on the imported track after local re-detection (MIG_DBG: imported tracklet present on 29 of 226 destination ticks). FIX ORDERED (writing session, Tyler informed): carry the imported track through the blind window: do not prune imported tids while coasting, seed from the memo bank every tick regardless of local update, source from lost_tracklets as well as tracked, run the predictor on the coasted migrated state, coast bounded by the existing window; publish gate unchanged (still suppressed until commit); arm difference must come only from the record (a snapshot arm coasts the same way and still needs five frames to mature). This is the prepared-track behavior §3 and §4 already describe. QUESTION PENDING before the rerun: if the ego consumed a local immature forecast in BOTH arms, what produced the measured cold-vs-warm separation in the headline and T25? Likely velocity-versus-nothing (cold has no destination track at all; migrating arms have the immature CV forecast from the transferred velocity), which would leave the headline mechanism sentence true but put the record-depth story above one frame entirely on the maneuvering panel. To be answered from one collided cold run and one completed warm run at the same seed.
- DEFECT B NOT CONFIRMED (eval session, Sep 10; KB fefaeb9b): three flow-smoke re-runs left the MODESROW gap at 77-111 ticks. Two causes, both in VERIFICATION: (1) the gap metric was unattributable: MODESROW/MIG_SEAM carried no locale tag and both edge managers log to one file with colliding per-manager tids, so "first MODESROW after crossing" mixed the SOURCE's own forecasts (which start ~120 ticks before the crossing and are identical in cold and warm) with the destination's, pinning the metric at ~80 regardless of the fix; same source-forecast confound as the FDE cold anchor. (2) In verify_warm the gating handoff (npc 201, prepare 254, crossing 257, first_dst_track 255) produced NO seam: only one track was seeded (tid 2, 10 frames, cids 197/199) while cid 201 mapped to tids {1,4,5,6}. Applied: locale id on the edge manager and on MODESROW/MIG_SEAM/MIG_DBG; verify rewritten to measure the DESTINATION first-MTR gap vs first_dst_track_tick per handoff plus a tid-fragmentation check. Writing session added: the missing seam on the gating track is the more serious signal (if the imported record lands on a track the planner never reads, migration is inert for the decision, a bigger defect than the maturity gap) and must be traced to identity split, association binding, or tracker drop; and after the verify passes, re-derive the FDE window anchor with the locale tag so the rerun is attributable from the start. Everything downstream (Defect A, probe sign-off, relay smoke, campaign rerun) held.
- PAPER 1fc17e4: the three gRPC round-trip numbers are commented out with a projected-source comment (relay timing row absent from every landed log; they return when a run with the relay up lands one); in-process serialization 0.2 ms and import 3.1 ms stand; the "refreshed in the following edge cycle" claim moved onto the parametric model (760 B transfers in ~3 ms, far inside the 200 ms cycle), which is what the closed-loop runs use; limitations no longer claims a measured loopback round trip. Dependency check: only that one refresh clause used 1.8 ms; the lead-time reasoning uses an online EMA for the transfer term plus three 200 ms cycles and a 350 ms margin (the 950 ms computed lead), so the lead, the capacity figure line, and every result judged against it are unaffected; the numbers appeared in no other prose, table, or macro. Pages 25/24.
- TRANSPORT AUDIT COMPLETE (eval session): (1) only the netem blocks used TRANSFER_MODE=grpc (frozen1j_netem and frozen1k_netem, 36 logs each, 217 fallbacks each, both on cetus); every other block on both machines used the parametric model by design and never attempted a gRPC send, so their outcomes stand. (2) ROOT CAUSE: atlas_tail.sh:27 launches relay_server on 50771 but cetus_1k_tail.sh never does, so the daemon's Prepare() to 127.0.0.1:50771 hit connection-refused on every transfer (daemon:281 -> :293 fallback). One-line fix plus a readiness wait. (3) [XFERROW] (prepare_ms/commit_ms) is written only inside the try after both gRPC calls succeed (daemon:288-291); there are ZERO [XFERROW] lines on either machine, so PREPARE 1.81 / COMMIT 0.29 / transfer 1.8 ms are NOT reproducible from any landed log and are dropped from the paper along with the impaired-link claims; in-process serialization 0.2 ms and import 3.1 ms are separate and stand. Ordered: fallback becomes LOUD in the 1m overlay (error-level log with the target, abort for transport-measuring blocks, or a marker every lander reads and refuses to emit transport columns on), relay launched with a readiness check on both machines before any transport block, and the one-cell fixed-relay smoke (no fallback, [XFERROW] present, transfer ~ 2x one-way + overhead at 3/20/50 ms) becomes the freeze-1m T8 transport block.
- PAPER af43877: impaired-link claims corrected to configuration statements, not measurements (methodology backhaul paragraph, §5.8 opener, transport appendix caption, §4 transport last sentence, and the limitations sentence written yesterday that claimed the gRPC implementation is measured under netem); the transport figure row is now generated with the reason and the pending lander named; the schema records that the existing lander's transfer column came from the parametric model and is flat across the grid. SURVIVING MEASURED TRANSPORT CLAIM: the unimpaired gRPC round trip (PREPARE 1.81 ms, COMMIT 0.29 ms, transfer 1.8 ms on loopback) from the separate round-trip test; the fork flagged that the same call path may be implicated, so its provenance is being checked in the fallback audit (which run, does it contain "grpc transfer failed", was the relay up). If those are parametric values the paper drops them too.
- NETEM BLOCK IS NOT MEASURED (eval session correction, supersedes the split above): "transfer failed" = "grpc transfer failed; parametric fallback" (daemon:293); counts 72/73/72 at loss 0/0.1/1% = loss-INDEPENDENT, ~one per transfer, firing even at 0% loss and 0 delay; retry_events 0. Every transfer fell back to the PARAMETRIC model (base 3 ms + payload/1 Gbps), which ignores netem, so the block measured the model at every cell and the netem panel would be flat by construction. The relay was not carrying traffic (setup defect, not a loss effect). CONSEQUENCES: netem transport AND outcomes both rerun on freeze-1m after the relay is fixed; there is no usable failures-per-loss-level number; the paper marks the netem figure and its sentences projected and drops any measured impaired-link transport claim. ORDERED: (a) audit every landed log set on both machines for "grpc transfer failed" and report per block/tag how many transfers fell back (blocks where all transfers fell back are internally consistent since every arm paid the same cost, but the paper must not describe them as using the gRPC path); (b) diagnose and fix the relay in the freeze-1m tail build (on the critical path: the impaired-link result is the only evidence the design survives a realistic backhaul), proven by a one-cell smoke with no fallback and transfer time tracking the injected delay at 3, 20, 50 ms.
- NETEM SPLIT (eval session check): loss arms complete safe (episodes 0, 6-7 transfers) but the logs carry cold start (11), fallback (328), transfer failed (72) markers, so loss sometimes hits a fallback rather than a retry; the retry path delivers the warm forecast and is defect-affected, the cold-fallback path is Defect-B-independent but is still a forecast-quality outcome. RULING: TRANSPORT columns measured on the current tag (transfer time, bytes, retransmits, transfer-failure counts; figure keeps them; also pull failure count per loss level and retries per failure); OUTCOME and forecast-quality columns rerun on freeze-1m; figure_status must say the block is transport-measured, outcomes pending. SHIFT MAPPING SIGNED OFF in advance: the axis (T_avail = decision arrival - crossing) is geometry/ego-approach dependent and valid pre-fix; the BLIND/DELIVERED boundary is provisional because the Defect A fix lowers the ~0.65 s delivery floor, re-confirmed in the Atlas smoke; if the cliff moves more than one shift level the shift set is re-picked so the cliff sits inside the swept range.
- CETUS 1k TAIL DONE (eval session f20b4d6c): t8 burst 30/30 + density 90/90 (EdgeWarp = edgewarp_full, correct; migrating arms carry the maturity defect -> superseded), visible 30/30 (EdgeWarp = SNAPSHOT, the confound -> appendix, superseded), netem 36/36 (warm + grpc under the netem grid; TRANSPORT columns are maturity-independent and likely reusable; collision/forecast columns are defect-affected). Writing session: netem transport columns accepted subject to one check (do any loss arms end in a cold-start fallback whose consequence is a forecast-quality question? if so only the transport columns survive). CETUS NOT IDLED for the fix: staged with the 1m overlay + corridor and running the boundary-shift probe cells at constant 12 m/s to produce the shift-to-T_avail mapping for sign-off (geometry-dependent, not maturity-dependent; provisional if the earlier forecast would move a cell's T_avail).
- §6-§8 REWRITE LANDED (fork b84fedc): positioning opener added; four related-work paragraphs in the Conductor pattern with all 40 citation keys preserved (key-set diffed before and after; the multiple-model survey kept alongside IMM though the reviewer's list omitted it); the first-implementation novelty claim deleted; limitations in five headed assumption/consequence paragraphs with the locale range and age limits scoped; conclusion in the established vocabulary ending on "deciding what state has to cross a boundary and sending it before the vehicles that depend on it need the answer". NETEM CONTRADICTION FIXED: limitations now says the locale processes share a host with the transfer modeled in the main runs and the gRPC implementation measured separately on the same host's loopback under netem; the other three descriptions (methodology, crossing load, transport appendix) already said loopback. One deviation kept: the conclusion says Khonsu matches replication's route success WITHIN RUN-TO-RUN VARIATION and names both counts (35 of 40 and 37 of 40) rather than asserting equality. Pages 25/24.
- §6-§8 REWRITE ORDERED (Tyler pasted the reviewer with near-verbatim replacement text): related work gains a positioning opener ("Khonsu is not a new tracking or cooperative perception model...") and four rewritten paragraphs in the Conductor pattern (what the class does, then the one dimension Khonsu differs on); the "first implementation of a state-space 3D tracker" novelty claim (related_work.tex:82-83) is DELETED; limitations becomes five headed assumption/consequence paragraphs (hardware and locale size, track representation and coordinate frames, cross-locale identity, evaluation scope, security) with the 200-325 m range and the 300/400 ms limits explicitly scoped; conclusion rewritten in the established vocabulary with the two headline comparisons via macros. FACTUAL CONTRADICTION FOUND BY THE REVIEWER: limitations.tex:39 says network sensitivity is measured "across physical hosts with Linux netem" while §4 (code-confirmed) says netem runs on one host's loopback; the loopback statement stands and limitations, §5.8, and the appendix are corrected.
- BACK-SECTIONS PASS LANDED (fork 28c5ebc): §6 related work, §7 limitations, §8 conclusion rewritten in the established language (no standalone "actor", "freshness", "migration target", "warm-up latency", "epoch fencing", "fresh enough" in either build); conclusion states the conditional claim (a snapshot suffices while motion stays approximately constant; changing motion CAN require recent history; if the decision precedes a transfer started at the boundary, the history must be sent in advance) with the closing numbers unchanged; limitations covers the coordinate convention, identity of non-connected road users, controlled perception, and the compromised-edge gap. Record table merged to "Full record (ten frames) 20/20 0.63" with the ten-frame cap in the caption; DEVIATION ACCEPTED: the fa_hist10 cell is GENERATED (the measured 1k block has 1, 2, 5 frames, kf, edgewarp snapshot, headline), so pooling to 29/30 would have mixed generated with measured; the measured arm stands alone and both docs warn against pooling until a ten-frame depth cell is actually run. Pages 25/24.
- TABLE 6 "10 frames" vs "full record" RESOLVED (eval session, code): IDENTICAL PAYLOADS. latent_from_tracklet truncates memo/diff/tick to memo[-history_depth:] (factories_1l:109-113) and the memo bank is capped at max_window=10 (flow yaml:160; tracklet_1l:267-268, 300-301), so memo[-10:] is the whole record; every other field is depth-independent. The 9/10 vs 20/20 difference is SEED COUNT (ablation cells 10 reps, headline warm arm 20), not record content. Ordered: merge into one row "Full record (ten frames)" reporting the pooled 29 of 30, caption states the ten-frame cap, and every other place treating them as distinct (prose, macros, figure, rules, schema, status) is corrected. The ablation gradient is 1/2/5/10 frames.
- REVIEWER PASS (Tyler, Sep 9 late 2): verdict = evaluation story done, remaining work is cleanup + page budget. Ordered: Table 7 caption and A.11 caveat lose the workflow language (no "older block", "rerun", tags); "10 of 10 and 10 of 10" -> one macro; Table 6 needs a sentence distinguishing "History, 10 frames" (9/10) from "Full record" (20/20) since K=10 (asked the eval session whether the payloads differ at all or only the seed count; PENDING until answered, no invented distinction); multi-CAV per-crossing phrasing; Fig 13 "fresh enough and safe" -> "within the age limit and safe". PART 2: §6 related work, §7 limitations, §8 conclusion never got the vocabulary pass and have reverted (migration targets, actor trajectories, freshness, kinematic snapshot, warm-up latency, track state, epoch fencing); rewritten in the established language, with the overclaim "maneuvering vehicles require multi-frame observation history" -> "changing motion can require recent observation history". LAYOUT: no float-only page; Figs 14 and 15 land 2-3 pages after their prose, which the reviewer reads (correctly) as the real page-budget limit rather than a layout bug: the next decision is which evaluation figures stay in the 12-page body.
- §5 REVIEWER FIXES LANDED (fork 881dd75): all nine items; pages 25 comment / 24 reviewer (from 26/25); body narrative now reaches related work on p15 and references on p17 in the reviewer build. FLOAT-ONLY PAGE RESOLVED: cutting the summary figure did not do it (that figure sat on p23); changing the surviving figure* from [tp] to [t] cleared it; no float-only page remains; late body floats 10 -> 4. Density block -> appendix A.11 whole with the EdgeWarp-snapshot caveat and a one-sentence body pointer; visible row kept in the cases table with its EdgeWarp cell rendered as a dash (macro gated to a dash so it cannot be printed by accident; a named set in plot_figures holds the blanked cell, one-line removal after the rerun) and the body sentence names the other methods. Summary figure and the duplicate two-locale flow table commented out (functions and numbers kept; four references re-pointed to the cases table). Table 12 headers now handoff messages and state transferred (KB). Remaining "per run" instances are correct usage (trigger bytes per run, scenario constants).
- EDGEWARP AUDIT (eval session): exactly one more block outside the record ablation carries EdgeWarp on the SNAPSHOT record: the VISIBLE MATRIX (viscon, cetus_1k_tail.sh:69 passes bare MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp, which maps to depth-1; the block does not go through _mode_args), confirmed in all 30 landed logs and in frozen1k_cetus_53_rows.csv. Everything else is edgewarp_full: density/burst t8, FDE subset, loaded hln (central and non-central), corridor and probes (no EdgeWarp arm). Fix: _mode_args applied to every block in the freeze-1m tail so no block can pass bare edgewarp; the freeze-1k visible data stands but its EdgeWarp cell is marked in the paper (appendix A.11 caveat with the density table) and the body does not compare EdgeWarp using it.
- REVIEWER PASS ON THE REWRITTEN §5 (Tyler, Sep 9 late): verdict "substantially better", no further rewrite; eight fixes ordered: (1) "two or more frames" wording (10-frame cell is 9/10); (2) "complete history banks" -> full observation history; (3) multi-CAV "per run" -> per boundary crossing, dangling "it" in the crossing-index sentence; (4) Table 13 headers "Actor state migrations"/"Migration bytes" -> "Handoff messages (PREPARE, COMMIT)"/"State transferred (KB)"; (5) "match" -> "approach or match" (overlap 23 and 33 of 40 vs Khonsu 35); (6) TABLE 14 CONFOUND: the density block ran EdgeWarp with the SNAPSHOT record, mixing trigger and state -> table and paragraph move to appendix A.11 with the caveat, body takes the rerun (cetus t8 already uses edgewarp_full; eval session confirmed the rule for every future comparison); (7) §5.9 summary too broad (Fig 6 constant panel contradicts it) + §5.6 slogan sentence, §5.5 unnecessary-transfer phrasing, §5.3 commit/age-limit phrasing; (8) LAYOUT: delete Fig 17 (summary figure* recombines Figs 6 and 9 with no new measurement), fix the FLOAT-ONLY PAGE 17 (Fig 14 alone on a page under figure* [tp]; try [t] per figure), and drop Table 7 (duplicated by Table 8 row 1). Body narrative reaches related work on page 16 with floats spilling to 17-19.
- SCRIPT OWNERSHIP FIXED (fork 74f5ffb): plot_figures.py owns every path the paper inputs; the five overlapping writers removed from make_floats.py (fig_envelope, fig_load, gen_tab_faults, gen_tab_fde), fig_lead_cdf PORTED into the registry (entry lead_cdf, measured handoffs first, shared trigger colors and below-axes legend, 231x181 pt); make_floats keeps only the density table and figure (measured on an older tag; the density macros are parsed from the generated table) with a split-of-ownership note in both files; a guard in make_floats main refuses to run if any of its outputs is in the registry. Verified: 18 of 19 floats pixel-identical after running both scripts; only the lead-time figure changed. tab_fde now points ONLY at the generated file with the superseded 1l lander named in a comment, so regeneration cannot pull it in.
- PAPER 8733f9d: last "predictor-mode" instance was in make_floats.py label strings (trigger table map + lead-time legend), not the LaTeX; both builds now zero. HAZARD FOUND: make_floats.py and plot_figures.py write the same paths (e.g. floats/fig_envelope.pdf), so running the older script silently replaces current figures; fix ordered (retire the overlapping writers from make_floats, guard against re-overlap, port or document the paths only it owns). figure_status FDE row carries a do-not-swap line naming the defect and the freeze-1m rerun.
- NO-HANDOFF REFERENCE ARM (freeze-1m FDE block): config-only single-locale arm (openscenario_1_flow_nohandoff_gt.yaml: one locale spanning the whole oncoming path with BOTH RSUs, no crossing, no migration); the env-suppressed variant does not work (RSU2 at x=205 cannot sense the conflict at x=278, so the source edge loses the track mid-path). CONSTRAINT (writing session): the reference gains two-RSU coverage where the migrated arms' destination has one, so log per run for the gating oncoming the contributing feeds per frame and the observation count at the anchor tick, in the reference and in warm; if the reference benefits from the second feed the paper calls it an upper bound with continuous two-RSU coverage, not a like-for-like control, and the "within a few centimeters" sentence becomes a stated gap with its cause. Block = 6 arms + reference, same seeds, same window/anchor -> frozen1m_fde_rows.csv.
- §5 PROSE PASS LANDED (fork 122de52): every subsection is question / what varies / headline / mechanism; diagnostics moved intact to Appendix A.6 tracker and record diagnostics, A.7 headline collision diagnostics, A.8 trigger sensitivity, A.9 overlap dwell and dual publication, A.10 handoff capacity detail; vocabulary applied to prose, captions, table headers, and figure axis labels; §5.8 retitled "Crossing load and failures"; pages 26 comment / 25 reviewer (from 27/25). Two macros added (MicroRatioMin/Max = 3 and 8; CapMedianCycleOne/Two) and one wording correction kept: the two tail crossings belong to different methods, not two steps of one curve. FDE SWAP DEFERRED: frozen1l_fde_rows.csv was measured with the maturity defect (every arm forecasts from re-accumulated local frames -> warm/reactive/handover cluster at 42-46 m) and has no no-handoff reference arm; Table 5 keeps its generated values; the block reruns on freeze-1m with a nohandoff arm added (ordered to the eval session) and figure_status gets a superseded note. Remaining: one "predictor-mode" instance in a generated table -> trajectory trigger.
- DECK: Tyler saved khonsu_story.pptx on OneDrive at 11:31 Sep 9 (notes only: provenance sentences removed from the multi-CAV and capacity notes; a ladder note added on the Backup divider); ported into the builder verbatim; v53 rebuilt with his edits and the resized figures, notes verified identical to his copy, repo commit 7bc6f49; PUSHED 20:10 after he closed OneDrive (pre-check: remote == his 11:31 save; byte-verified). Last verified push = verify_v53.pptx. §5 PROSE PASS ORDERED (Tyler pasted the reviewer): question / what varies / headline / why per subsection; diagnostics to Appendix A.6-A.9 (record-ablation diagnostics, headline collision diagnostics, trigger sensitivity, dual publication + dwell table); vocabulary table (forecast age, age limit, ready before first use, time to the first destination forecast, recipient CAV, destination locale, distance trigger, trajectory trigger, unnecessary transfer, real crossing, concurrent crossings, state preparation time, route success); §5.8 retitled "Crossing load and failures". CONFLICT RISK: Tyler's Gemini edits (unsynced) may touch evaluation.tex; resolve by paragraph at his sync.
- FIGURE HEIGHTS LANDED (fork d185bdd + 9e334b1): regions 340 -> 221 pt, envelope 340 -> 225, load 331 -> 231, overlap 325 -> 221, corridor_route 303 -> 195, multiego 338 -> 223; legibility checked per figure and page; pages 27 main / 25 mock. Deck v53 built with the resized figures; OneDrive pre-check FAILED (remote != verify_v52): remote diffed by slide before any push.
- FIGURE HEIGHT PASS ORDERED (fork): cap single-column floats at ~250 pt and the multi-CAV figure* at ~210 pt (regions/envelope/load/overlap/corridor_route ~303-340 pt today; multiego 338), tighter panel spacing, legends in one row, no data removed, legibility and grayscale checks per figure and page.
- WHITESPACE ROOT CAUSE (writing session, Sep 9 night; the reviewer's bounding-box hypothesis is WRONG: every floats/fig_*.pdf ink bbox equals its page size within a few points, and an \fbox around Figure 9 is tight): the holes on pages 11/15/16 were FLOAT COLUMNS: with "p" allowed and "!" bypassing \floatpagefraction, LaTeX put single small floats on float columns, vertically centered (blank above and below); and the two figure* environments block every later column figure (same-class ordering), which is why plain [t] deferred everything. Fix (committed): column floats [ht] (no float pages), figure* [tp] (a stuck full-width figure takes a float page instead of blocking the queue), \@fptop = 0pt. Measured on the comment build: holes over six lines only on page 19 (9 lines, both columns: the figure* float page); late floats Fig 15 (17 -> 19) and Fig 16 (17 -> 20), structural; pages 27 main / 28 mock (was 27/27 under the float-column configuration; the mock gained one page because floats no longer sit on float columns; the trim pass absorbs it).
- FLOAT CONFIGURATION (fork 91c7897): [!htbp] chosen. Comparison on the comment build: (a) [!htbp] and (b) [!tbp] identical: 27/27 pages, five body floats printed later than the page after their reference (Table 7, Table 14, Figs 15, 16, 18), three columns with blank runs over six lines (p11 R 12, p15 R 15, p16 R 9); (c) [H] + raggedbottom: 27/26, four late floats, five columns with 14-36-line holes. Residual late floats are structural (Fig 16 referenced from §5.7 a section early; Table 7 referenced at §5.3's start; figure* takes a page top); the trim pass after the data freeze re-sequences references.
- PAPER b8cff6c + d6de38b + 3435e90 + 72fda32 (fork): §4 reviewer pass applied (handoff layer, theta 0.5, hysteresis 4 ticks, lead-budget reconciliation with a freeze-1m NOTE, early-preparation measurements moved to §5.5, import evaluated-config-first + shadow track, same-frame round-trip test sentence, exact bytes table 280/280/40/56/104/760/64/1247, 84% of array content, 3D adaptation sentence, transport environments corrected: closed loop on the parametric 3 ms link; netem on loopback, "between two hosts" removed from §4/§5.1/§5.8/appendix). FLOAT PASS: all 29 body [H] -> [!tbp] (figure* [!t]); page count 27/27; but six floats now print two or more pages after their first reference (Tables 7; Figs 7, 14, 15, 16, 18) and six columns keep blank runs of 9-15 lines. Ordered: compare [!htbp] vs [!tbp] vs the [H]+raggedbottom state on both builds (page count, late floats, blank runs) and commit the winner (no float more than one page late, fewest holes).
- §4 CODE FACTS (eval session): record layout payload.py:71-91: memo_bank 280 B + diff_memo_bank 280 B (10 rows, birth row zero) + memo_tick 40 B + bbox 28 + predicted 28 + vel 8 = 664 B array content; +96 B scalar/header = 760 B record; +64 B bundle header; history share 560/664 = 84%. 3D MambaTrack adaptation: 7-param box, SSM motion x,y,z,yaw with 8-dim input embedding, 3D GIoU loss; two-round association retained. Transport: serialization 0.2 / import 3.1 ms in-process; PREPARE 1.81 / COMMIT 0.29 / transfer 1.8 ms = gRPC to the relay over same-host loopback (daemon_1l:260-291); CLOSED LOOP uses the PARAMETRIC link (link.py:82-123: base 3.0 ms one-way, jitter 0.5 ms, 1000 Mbps, 5G-MOBIX D5.2 Table 30) -> ~3 ms transfer, not 1.8; netem impairment is applied on LOOPBACK (cetus_1k_tail.sh:76-81: delay {0,3,20,50}, jitter {0,0.5,1,2}, loss {0,0.1,1}%, no bandwidth cap), NOT between two hosts: paper text in §4, §5.1, §5.8, and the appendix caption to be corrected. Second §4 commit ordered to the fork.
- WHITESPACE (Tyler, Sep 9 evening): cause in the comment build = \ptag ending with a forced line break (an empty stretchable line before every \paragraph) under flush-bottom, plus 29 body [H] floats; the mock build had no holes. Fixed bc7f341: \ptag ends with \par; \raggedbottom after \begin{document}; USENIX geometry untouched (usenix-2020-09.sty: 10 pt Times, 7 x 9 in text block, 0.33 in column sep; page numbers printed) -> compliant. Fork queued after §4: convert the 29 body [H] floats to [t]/[tbp] with a float-vs-reference and rendered-page check; no spacing-length changes, no \vspace.
- §4 PASS ORDERED (Tyler pasted the reviewer, Sep 9 evening; "Make these changes"; no Overleaf sync yet, so his Gemini edits are still only in Overleaf: conflict risk accepted for implementation.tex): K histories sentence, 3D-adaptation sentence, MTR sentence, velocity-units -> reason, "source update time", subsection renamed "Cross-locale handoff layer" (migration -> handoff as synonym; "track record" for the serialized object), theta = 0.5 (MTR_THETA default, openscenario_1_flow_gt.py:96) and serving-locale hysteresis = 4 consecutive ticks / 0.2 s (LOCALE_MIN_DWELL_TICKS, :73; binding.py:68) stated, lead-budget reconciliation (3.1 ms import vs three 0.6 s cycles; NOTE that freeze-1m removes two cycles), M and cap rationale, early-preparation measurements moved to §5.5, import paragraph evaluated-config-first + shadow track defined, unit-test claim as same-frame round trip, bytes sentence with the 600/720 denominator, transport environments labeled. Code facts requested from the eval session: payload layout (K vs K-1 differences, bytes), 3D adaptation scope, transport environments + emulated link parameters.
- DEFECT B FIX IMPLEMENTED (edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch._ab3d_history_to_trajs: for imported tracks (carrying _migrated_vel_mps) ot.trajectory is rebuilt from the tracklet memo_bank in source-tick order, newest at index 0, capped at maxlen; [MIG_SEAM] logged per import; factories_1l sets t._n_imported). Phasing approved: unit test (§4) -> flow smoke verifying B (dest MODESROW first cycle after commit for warm; kf MTR after five local frames; clean seam) -> defect A with markers -> finer probe + mapping sign-off -> whole-campaign rerun on freeze-1m. Confirmation requested that reactive, edgewarp_full, and the record-ablation arms all take the same seeding (maturity after 4/3/0 local frames for one_frame/hist2/hist5).
- DEFECT B ROOT CAUSE (eval session): inject_latent_into_tracker sets t.memo_bank = latent.memo_bank (10 frames, factories_1l:170) but the predictor's maturity gate reads len(ot.trajectory) (mtr_edge_predictor_1m:304) and ot.trajectory is cleared and rebuilt every tick from the edge's LOCAL hist deque (_ab3d_history_to_trajs, edge:1716-1751); the imported memo_bank never enters it, so MTR waits for five LOCAL frames (~80 ticks) and then forecasts from local frames only -> the FDE cluster (warm ~ reactive ~ handover). FIX: seed ot.trajectory from the tracklet memo_bank (imported + local, source-tick order, cadence-correct via memo_tick; seam logged) so a full-record import is mature at the first destination cycle and a prepared shadow runs MTR pre-commit (suppressed). Writing session added: the §4 unit test (export/import each backend; memo bank equality; destination's first forecast on the imported record equals the source's) is to be implemented for real in freeze-1m and run in the smoke. Defect A measured after B with [MIG_COMMIT]/[MIG_APPLY]/[MIG_PUBLISH]; cadence waits removed so a prepared track is usable within one cycle of commit.
- TWO DEFECTS IN THE PREPARED-TRACK PATH (Sep 9 evening; Tyler: "you need to fix that. If it doesn't match, it's not right"): (A) delivery floor: commit at tick 86 -> first use 99 = 3.25 edge cycles for a track prepared before the crossing; must be one cycle plus a planner tick (final update applied and published in the arrival cycle). (B) predictor maturity: on a full-record import the destination's MTR multimodal forecast does not resume until tick 166 (~4 s after commit); the ego consumes the immature kinematic forecast meanwhile; the ten migrated frames must count toward the predictor's history from the first cycle after import, and for a prepared shadow MTR should run pre-commit (suppressed, not skipped). Defect B also explains the FDE table (warm ~ reactive ~ handover 42-46 m: every arm's forecast is the destination's own after re-accumulation). Ordered: markers [MIG_COMMIT]/[MIG_APPLY]/[MIG_PUBLISH], diagnosis, fix in freeze-1m, smoke (first use within one cycle of commit; dest MODESROW in the first cycle for warm; kf after five local frames), finer shift probe on the fixed path, sign-off. RERUN SCOPE: the WHOLE campaign on freeze-1m (headline, trigger, record ablation, loaded, T25, maneuvering shift sweep, T25b, then non-central), both machines: a migration-path defect invalidates every migrating arm's rows on 1k/1l. Estimated ~40 h wall on two machines -> Sep 11-12 if no further defects.
- CONSTANT-12 SHIFT PROBE (warm): crossing tick ~= 86 + 1.70 |shift|; sh 0: crossing 86, first_use 99, dec ~110-140, T_avail ~1.2-2.0 s, delivered, safe; sh -30: crossing 137, first_use 145, dec ~140, T_avail ~0.15 s, NOT delivered; sh -60/-90: blind, collision; sh -120: oncoming never crosses in time. FINDING: delivery latency first_use - crossing ~= 13 ticks = 0.65 s is a PHYSICAL FLOOR on usable T_avail even for Khonsu (prepared track); below it every arm launches blind -> cliff, not a separation. Regimes: delivered (> ~0.65 s), delivery floor (~0.65, comparable to reactive's 0.6-1.2 s), blind (< ~0.65). At constant speed gate_accel = 0 for every arm (cv == kin, byte-identical), so warm vs kf can only show at commanded 2. dec has ~30-tick run-to-run noise (creep) -> pinned per run. SIGN-OFF (writing session): finer probe at shifts {+10, 0, -10, -18, -26} (T_avail ~2.5 -> 0.3 s) at 12 m/s and commanded 2, warm and kf; the panel INCLUDES the blind regime (regions on the maneuvering panel: blind / preparation required / history required / snapshot sufficient). Ordered: breakdown of Khonsu's 13-tick post-crossing floor (commit RPC -> final update applied -> next edge publish -> planner consumption; how many 200 ms cycles are cadence waits); shortening it is a separate decision.
- SHIFT GEOMETRY (eval session): default accel run: ego westbound x 317 -> 223, reaches the conflict x=278 at ~tick 285; oncoming eastbound spawns x=210, crosses the destination boundary x=240 at ~f85, passes the conflict at ~f113 (clears long before the ego arrives -> mature path at the decision). ONCOMING_SHIFT_X shifts only the oncoming actors (truck/conflict and ego fixed); west shift = later crossing. Probe running on Atlas: constant 12 m/s, warm, shifts {0,-30,-60,-90,-120}. T_AVAIL DEFINITION FIX (writing session): the spawn shift does not change boundary-to-conflict distance; T_avail per shift = focal CAV's first arrival at the decision point (first hold-or-launch tick behind the truck, arm-independent, ~195 in flow) minus the oncoming's crossing tick, times dt; launch minus crossing is the arm-dependent annotation. §5.3 definition to change accordingly when the paper reopens; t_avail_s column carries the arm-independent value.
- KINEMATIC GATE BUILT (behavior_agent_1m + edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch + mtr_edge_predictor_1m, py_compile clean): closed-form first positive root of 0.5 a t^2 + (v + 7) t - clear = 0; obs.gate_accel from _estimate_accel_mps2 on the tracklet memo_bank (cadence-correct via memo_tick) floored at MIGRATION_ACCEL_FLOOR, gate_accel_src in {none, migrated, local}; MTR full walk and endpoint slope logged only. ONCOMING_SHIFT_X was NOT implemented in scenario_1_1l (TRIGGER_DIST decouples the oncoming start; default accel run: oncoming crosses at tick 78, ego launches at 200 -> mature path); eval session implements the shift and PROBES each candidate on Atlas (idle) to measure T_avail and destination frames at the launch, at constant 12 m/s and at commanded 2, mapping sent for sign-off before the smoke; shifts chosen so constant-speed T_avail ~0.3/0.6/1.0/1.5/2.5 s; conflict point and truck fixed.
- KINEMATIC GATE SPEC CONFIRMED (eval session building): edge attaches obs.gate_accel + gate_accel_src per track = destination's own estimate once local frames >= the floor window (converges for every arm at long T_avail), else migrated est_a (warm; 0 for kf/handover), else 0; gate solves 0.5 a t^2 + (v + 7) t - clear >= 0 in closed form (a = 0 -> clear/(v + 7) = the old gate exactly), GO iff t >= 4 s; distance/speed only without a track; MTR crossing check unchanged; full field logged only; no speed cap in the gate (extrapolated speed at the meeting logged); per-run row records gate_accel_src at the launch. Part 2 geometry (shift_x, T_avail, destination frames at launch) for sign-off before launch.
- 1m SMOKE = ADVERSE PREDICTOR RESULT (eval session, Sep 9 ~16:45): in every cell the full-forecast walk finds no meeting within 5 s (src=full_beyond_horizon) because MTR's mature forecast is stop-biased (oncoming stops ~13 m in), so the gate falls back to CV: flow_warm cv 2.65 s -> WAIT; accel c2 warm 2.42, kf 2.36 -> both WAIT then GO after the oncoming clears; episodes 0; warm = kf. The endpoint-slope proxy would have said GO (5.5-6.7 s) into an 11.5 m/s oncoming: the full MTR forecast is harmful if consumed by the gate. Flow 1m vs 1l: migration timing identical, outcome byte-identical (launch +20 ticks, seed artifact). The decision consumed the MATURE path at c2 (>= 5 destination frames), so any kinematic estimate converges to local frames and warm = kf regardless: the state difference exists only inside the immature window (short T_avail). DECISION (writing session, under Tyler's P0 + option 1; Tyler informed): (a) the gate walks the KINEMATIC forecast of the delivered track (CA from current position/velocity with the carried acceleration: migrated est_a, local estimate once frames exceed the floor window, zero for kf/handover/below-floor; distance/speed only without a track); MTR keeps the crossing-conflict check; full field logged only. Maneuvering block REDESIGNED as the regions maneuvering panel: commanded 2 (GT ~3.9) x ONCOMING_SHIFT_X sweep with T_avail ~0.3/0.6/1.0/1.5/2.5 s (short end inside the immature window), arms warm, warm accel-off, kf, reactive, cold x10 -> frozen1m_acc_rows.csv (shift_x_m, t_avail_s); constant panel = T25b (same shifts at 12 m/s) + T25 -> frozen1m_t25b/t25_rows.csv; the accel-magnitude sweep is dropped as the panel (est_a vs GT stays as the estimator validation). Smoke first: shortest + 1.0 s shifts at c2 warm/kf and flow warm @12 vs 1l.
- FDE RE-LANDED (d9bb1256; window_anchor column: commit for migrated arms, first local track for cold): fde5/fde3/top5 means: edgewarp 40.6/26.8/49.2, warm 42.0/26.6/50.7, reactive 44.9/28.6/53.7, cold 45.4/29.3/55.5 (seed-varying now), handover 45.6/29.5/54.5, kf 58.5/44.1/66.7. Ordering: warm and edgewarp best, kf worst; cold mid-pack on its under-speed rebuilt track because the local forecast is also stop-biased. Table 5 (FDE per arm) swaps to measured when the paper reopens after Tyler's Gemini sync.
- AGES AT THE LAUNCH DECISION (eval session): own load (1k reference) ~200/400 ms median/p95; N=20 ~250/450-600; N=31 300-400 median, ~1000 p95 (cold 300/955 ... warm 400/1056): migration holds to ~1 s realized age at N=31 while cold fails. COLD FDE BUG: run_fde anchors the window at first_dst_track_tick; cold has no migration -> fallback to the first five MODESROW ticks (32-37, the source edge's earliest forecast, seed-independent) -> identical rows. Ruling: cold is NOT N/A (the destination tracks the oncoming from its crossing and the focal CAV consumes that rebuilt forecast at the launch); anchor cold's window at the destination's own first track of the gating oncoming (own_first_forecast_tick), migrated arms stay commit-anchored; schema states the anchor; re-land. FDE 3 s means: warm 26.6, edgewarp 26.8, reactive 28.6, handover 29.5, kf 44.1 (top-mode 5 s 49-67). No 1.25 s FDE (MODESROW logs 3 and 5 s only). T25b reorder acked; shift levels + T_avail for sign-off before launch.
- LANDED Sep 9 ~16:40: hl_n31 and hl_n20 (frozen1l_hl_n31/n20_rows.csv, 70 rows each): success/10 at N=31: warm 10, edgewarp 10, handover 10, warm_ablation 10, kf 9 (1 collision), reactive 9 (1 timeout), cold 2 (4 collisions + 4 timeouts); at N=20: warm/edgewarp/handover/warm_ablation/reactive 10, kf 9 (1 collision), cold 4. Paper rules: per-arm PASS; "N=31 reactive separated from Khonsu" FAILS: the projected loaded separation (reactive 4/10) does not exist because the launch decision is ~2 s after commit at this geometry (same cause as the record ablation), so reactive's warm-up never reaches the decision at any radio load; measured loaded story = cold falls further under load, every migrating arm holds. FDE subset (frozen1l_fde_rows.csv, 852e32f9, 30 rows): fde5_m means warm 42.0, edgewarp 40.6, reactive 44.9, handover 45.6, cold 51.3, kf 58.5 (huge: MTR's mature forecast is stop-biased, mtr_implied_a ~ -5.7); the five cold rows are IDENTICAL across seeds (51.332/29.182/57.291) -> verification ordered. Consequences: the reactive-timing story lives only at short T_avail -> T25b (boundary shift at 12 m/s, smallest T_avail ~0.5 s) moved FIRST in the non-central chain (on the 1m gate after the accel/T25 reruns if the smoke passes); Table 5 FDE will read ~40-60 m (real numbers, not 0.6-1.6); the intro/§5.3 loaded sentences change to the measured result when Tyler's Gemini edits sync (paper prose held). Two stale watcher shells from Sep 6-7 still alive on Atlas (harmless).
- STATUS Sep 9 ~16:30 (writing session check of idfix_wt/evaluation_outputs): CENTRAL DONE (hln31 70 logs, hln20 70 logs, acc 250, _1l_central_done), FDE SUBSET DONE (_fde_subset_done); Atlas idle (non-central held at the epoch_smoke_ok gate); hln and FDE rows NOT yet landed in the KB. Ordered: run the 1m smoke on Atlas now (not behind the cetus tail), land hln31/hln20/FDE rows with rules, then the accel rerun on Atlas if the smoke passes and T25 on cetus after the tail.
- FREEZE-1m BUILT (eval session; staged on cetus /tmp/m_stage, no rerun): mtr_edge_predictor_1m.py attaches predicted_trajectory_full (25 MTR steps at 0.2 s, world frame) on mature-MTR preds and on immature-import preds (constant-accel extrapolation to 5 s carrying mig_accel_mps2), full_dt attr; backstop field and num_output_steps untouched. behavior_agent_1m.py = 1k_epoch (fence kept) + gate: _nearest_oncoming_ahead returns (clear, speed, arrival); _gate_arrival walks the full forecast to the ego's advancing overtake front (meeting = first t with onc_ahead <= 7 t, interpolated), fallback distance/current speed beyond 5 s or no forecast; decision at the initial gate, per-tick recheck, and recommit = arrival >= 4 s (equivalent to the old clear >= 4 (7 + v) at constant speed); endpoint extrapolation logged only; [GATE ARR] logs cv/full_walk/endpoint/src/arrival + consumed cid per decision tick. Smoke /tmp/cetus_1m_smoke.sh flock-waits behind the 1k tail, ahead of the corridor: flow warm @12 on 1m vs 1l (same seed) + accel commanded 2 warm and kf; report in frozen_1m_smoke/_report.txt (RUNROW, HANDOFFROW, GATE ARR, launch tick, decision_path, mtr_implied_a). Atlas: central -> FDE subset (1l, valid).
- GATE HORIZON REFINEMENT: the delivered predicted_trajectory is only 1.25 s (num_output_steps 25 at 0.05 s; the model makes 5 s) and the backstop reads the same field, so the gate cannot use it for a 2.5-4 s meeting. Eval session proposed endpoint-velocity extrapolation from the last two samples; writing session ruled: emit the model's full 5 s horizon as a second, gate-only field (predicted_trajectory_full), walk it to the pass zone, fallback distance/current speed beyond 5 s or without a forecast; backstop and num_output_steps untouched; log distance/speed, full-walk, and endpoint-extrapolated arrivals + horizon covered + source at every decision tick. RISK TO EXPOSE, NOT HIDE: mtr_implied_a ~ -5.7 for an accelerating oncoming (1l accel rows); if MTR's 5 s forecast implies a later meeting than CV, the full-walk gate makes warm LAUNCH (worse than kf) = a predictor finding; the smoke's decision_path column (coast/immature CA path vs mature MTR) is read first.
- TYLER: OPTION 1 (Sep 9): freeze-1m = 1l overlay (incl. _epoch files) + the overtake gate consuming the forecast-trajectory arrival + the redesigned accel scenario (commanded 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3). Smokes ordered before any rerun: flow warm @12 on 1m vs 1l (byte-identical outcome; gate arrival and distance/speed both logged); accel commanded 2 warm vs kf (warm waits, kf launches; arrival estimates logged at the decision). Then reruns split across machines: accel (250 runs) -> frozen1m_acc_rows.csv, T25 (200 runs) -> frozen1m_t25_rows.csv; headline, trigger, F, and hln stay on 1k/1l; non-central releases after T25 (freshness first, accel level from the new sweep). Tag, overlay, and gate version recorded per block.
- GATE FIX FULLY SPECIFIED (eval session, read-only): predicted_trajectory samples are one sim tick apart (_to_world, mtr_edge_predictor_1l.py:775-802 resamples 25 x 0.2 s MTR steps; sample k at (k+1) x _output_dt), horizon ~5 s; arrival = first sample entering the ego overtake corridor, interpolated; fallback distance/kf_speed beyond the horizon or without a forecast; no proto change. Holding the build for Tyler's scope call. Chain: acc05 (a = 0.5 on the old gate) SKIPPED (the accel block reruns whole on the new gate under every option); FDE subset next (gate-independent, stays valid), then non-central; when the scope is cleared, accel + T25 reruns on freeze-1m go ahead of unstarted non-central blocks.
- ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED (eval session, code): the overtake go/no-go (_nearest_oncoming_ahead, behavior_agent_1k.py:1092-1168) uses traj[0].location (current position, :1123) and obs.kf_speed_mps (current tracker speed, :1140); traj[1] only tests direction (:1151-1156); consumers = initial gate :2263-2272 (GO iff clear >= 4.0*(7.0 + kf_speed)), recheck :1765-1766, recommit :1813-1815. The forecast horizon feeds only trajectory_collision_check (:845-879) = the emergency-brake backstop, not the decision. Hence warm = kf by construction under acceleration (warm's accel-aware forecast fires the brake more, the outcome is equal); cold differs only by having no track. PROPOSED PLANNER CHANGE (freeze-1m, every arm): the gate computes the oncoming's time to reach the pass zone from the delivered forecast trajectory (walk samples, interpolate with the trajectory dt; confirm the resampled ~0.02 s parameterization and the 5 s horizon at build) and compares it with the maneuver time (4 s); fallback distance/speed when no forecast (cold, immature); recheck and recommit use the same arrival; backstop unchanged. Constant-speed blocks should not move in expectation. RERUN SCOPE + HOURS: accel redesigned (5 arms x 5 levels x 10 = 250 runs, ~11 h one GPU, ~6 h split) + T25 (200 runs, ~9 h, ~5 h split) = minimum for a single-tag regions figure; hln (30 runs @N=20, ~2-2.5 h) if the cases table must be one tag; whole central campaign ~13-14 h + cetus tail ~7-8 h if everything moves. Recommendation: accel + T25 on freeze-1m; headline/B/F/hln stay unless a table merges them with the maneuvering panel. AWAITING TYLER.
- SUCCESS TABLES (eval session; completed = distance >= 90 m, so a pure wait fails): T25 success/10: cold 0,0,10,10,10 at v8..v24 (collides 10/10 at v8, v12); reactive 10,9,10,10,10; warm 8,10,10,10,10; kf 10,10,10,10,7 (3 never-launched timeouts at v24); never-launched 0 elsewhere -> high-speed successes are real launched passes; totals/50 reactive 49, warm 48, kf 47, cold 30. ACCEL: every arm 10/10 at every level, aborts ~0, holds 0, backstop fires 15-43 per run in every arm with no warm-vs-kf order, completion time within noise; warm launches ~0.75 s earlier at a >= 4 with no outcome effect. GT accel per commanded level: 3.89 (a2), 6.37, 6.25, 6.36, 6.28 (a3-a6 plateau at the speed cap ~22.8 m/s) -> two physical levels. ROOT-CAUSE CANDIDATE (writing session): the overtake gate + recheck read the near anchor + tracker speed (behavior_agent_1k.py:1092-1168), never the forecast horizon, so the forecast difference between warm and kf cannot reach the decision by construction; no scenario tightening can separate them. Proposed minimal planner change (applied to every arm): the gate takes the oncoming's time to reach the pass zone from the delivered forecast trajectory (fallback distance/speed when no forecast); recheck and backstop unchanged. Code confirmation + rerun scope + hours requested; Tyler decides (planner = the consumer under test; one tag per table forces at least accel + T25 on the new overlay, possibly hln). Accel levels for the redesign: commanded 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 (GT ~2.5-4.5) + 3 (plateau 6.3).
- 2026-09-09 EARLY: Tyler edited §3 himself (dc7685d Conductor narrative order: overview, three principles, payload, timing, handoff, failure handling; ca41535 polish) and those commits are IN main; there is no pending Overleaf sync and no conflict risk (CORRECTION: the writing session wrongly carried a "held for his sync" caveat for hours). His pasted reviewer texts are instructions to this session, not another tool's pending work; the abstract rewrite (reviewer's Conductor-voice version: CAVs, road users, position-and-velocity snapshot, "send the track history", "sent only at the boundary", no reactive transfer / actor / temporal track state in the abstract) is HELD for after his sync. CORRIDOR STAGED on cetus (T13): /tmp/cetus_corridor_smoke.sh (epoch byte-identical flow smoke -> /tmp/epoch_smoke_ok on Atlas; one corridor route EF=1 showing two [CORRIDORCROSS] epochs, [PUBGATE_SRC], [CONSUMEDEPOCH] tail) and /tmp/cetus_corridor_campaign.sh (70 routes: 6 arms x10 at EF=1 + warm EF=0 x10) behind the 1k tail. T25 RERUN LANDED (frozen1k_t25_rows.csv, 200 rows, 4e2d1959): collisions/10: v8 cold 10, warm 2, kf 0, reactive 0; v12 cold 10, reactive 1; v16/20/24 all 0. Separation = cold vs migrated, strongest at LOW speed; at high speed the ego waits in every arm; warm vs kf never separates on collisions; at v24 warm completes 10/10 overtakes, kf 7/10 (3 timeouts). ACCEL a=2..6 LANDED (frozen1l_acc_rows.csv, 250 rows, f2718cc2): 0 collisions in every arm at every level; est_a tracks GT (~6.23 vs ~6.3); GT accel PLATEAUS at ~6.3 for commanded >= 3 (vehicle limit); the collision checker + emergency brake backstop saves every arm; warm brakes MORE (ghost brakes 33 vs kf 23 at a=6). Eval session proposes (a) FDE-only maneuvering panel or (b) scenario tightening + full rerun. WRITING SESSION: framing waits on the SUCCESS tables (completed AND not collided; timeouts = failures) per arm x speed / x level with launch, abort, backstop, completion columns and the no-launch count; direction under Tyler's rules = (b) with a completion window applied equally to all arms if the panel does not separate on the metric; (a) alone not acceptable for a closed-loop claim. NOTE for §5.3: measured T25 inverts the projected regions logic for cold (fails at LONG T_avail where the overtake is attempted, passes at SHORT T_avail where every arm waits): "success" at short T_avail may be a wait, not a completed maneuver; the no-launch column decides.
- PAPER 0ba2c53 (fork): terminology pass landed: ego 22 -> 0 (focal CAV 9, recipient CAVs), warm 38 -> 7 (all "warm-up"), compliance 19 -> 0, freshness budget 3 -> 0 (age limit 33), temporal track state 12 -> 4 (definition + pointers), record 58 -> 8, reactive history 30 -> 0 (reactive transfer), final sync 10 -> 0 (final update), actor 110 -> 58 (architecture sections only; §3 defines "actor (any tracked road user)"), application binding 0, prepare-to-ready 0 (state preparation), import load 0 (handoff processing load); section titles 5.2-5.6 renamed; metrics paragraph in the Conductor form; multi-CAV paragraphs rewritten; all float labels relabeled (Fig 15 title "Multiple CAVs across four locales"); figure_schemas maps column names to words. 28 pp main / 26 mock. DECK v52 PUSHED (2dbee65): builder vocabulary pass + relabeled figures; rendered deck text has zero ego/warm-before/compliance/reactive history/final sync/application binding. Last verified push = verify_v52.pptx.
- TERMINOLOGY PASS (Tyler pasted the reviewer, Sep 8 late): back to the Conductor vocabulary: focal CAV (single-planner experiments), recipient CAVs (multi-CAV block), ready before first use (not warm), forecasts within the age limit (not freshness compliance), fresh enough and safe, track history / transferred track state (temporal track state defined once), reactive transfer (not reactive history), replication with final update (not final sync), vehicle (not actor, in experiments), serving locale (no application binding), state preparation time, handoff processing load, boundary crossings, destination locale; section titles 5.2 "When is track history needed?", 5.3 "When is a simple handoff enough?", 5.4 "How old can a forecast be?", 5.5 "When should Khonsu send the track?", 5.6 "Alternative handoff designs"; metrics paragraph and multi-CAV paragraphs rewritten in the Conductor form; Fig 15 labels. Memory saved (feedback_khonsu_conductor_vocabulary). Fork running the paper pass (all label strings in plot_figures/make_floats included; schema column names unchanged, mapping line added). Deck builder pass done locally (ego -> focal CAV / recipient CAVs, warm -> ready, compliance -> forecasts within the age limit, actor -> vehicle outside the architecture slides, reactive transfer, final update, state preparation time); deck push waits for the relabeled floats.
- SOURCE-SIDE FENCE BUILT (eval session, afc730): publish gate at edge_manager_merged_1l_epoch:790-807 previously filtered only by _shadow_obstacles; EPOCH_FENCE=1 drops tracks with own.tracks[cid].publishable == False (set by source_commit, ownership.py:80) and logs [PUBGATE_SRC] dropped_after_commit=1, so the source stops publishing the old epoch (both-emit window = commit-propagation delay); EPOCH_FENCE=0 = today's behavior (off arm); planner-side rule kept, dormant. Faults block tags flt_<fault>_ef{0,1}; lander emits stale_owner_consumed + both_emit_window_ms; schema faults row updated. DOUBLE GATE: non-central runner waits for _fde_subset_done AND /tmp/epoch_smoke_ok (written only after the byte-identical flow smoke); _epoch overlay re-staged to cetus for the corridor + smoke. Corridor Khonsu EPOCH_FENCE=0 arm goes into the corridor campaign script; lander joins CONSUMEDEPOCH vs dest-commit tick and both_emit from PUBGATE_SRC vs dest first publish. Smokes at the cetus T25-landing window.
- PAPER 4311836 (fork): multi-ego block tightened (seed as the statistical unit: per-seed rates, bootstrap 95% across seeds, MeCompHw*/MeSuccHw* half-widths; generator gained a shared per-run offset; sweep C wording "offered traffic population, spawn schedule, and actor-crossing workload fixed"; per-count success 100/100/95/91%; p99 in edge cycles 2.0/2.0/3.0/5.0, median 0.9; contribution 3 sentence; knee tied to Fig 16). 29 pp main / 26 mock. DECK v50 (multi-ego notes) then v51 PUSHED: every graph slide converted to the reviewer's template via a new gslide() builder (one flowing text frame: how-to-read block X/Y/Compare in grey labels, one or two numbers, one bold takeaway; figure right, or top band + figure for wide figures); retitles: "Recent history helps when motion changes", "A handoff can lose the motion history already learned", "At constant speed, a velocity snapshot is enough", "When motion changes, both state and timing matter", "Which handoff method is enough depends on motion and available time", "How old can a forecast be before it is no longer useful?", "Predicting the crossing gives an early handoff without moving everything", "Overlap works, but wider overlap costs more", "Khonsu gets similar continuity without continuous duplication", "Repeated handoffs do not degrade Khonsu", "More consumers are cheap, more physical vehicles create load" (status Done per the reviewer), "Khonsu has headroom beyond the corridor's normal crossing load", "Locale size is bounded in both directions"; conflicts slide now shows the ECDF float. Notes unchanged. Rendered checks clean. Last verified push = verify_v51.pptx.
- REVIEWER ON THE MULTI-EGO BLOCK (Tyler pasted): shapes match for the right reasons (actor-state work not proportional to consumers, fanout 4.1 not 8, flat-then-knee, median flat while p99 steps in cycles, non-monotone 404 -> 389 kept). Four tightenings ordered to the fork: statistical unit = seed (per-seed per-ego rate, bootstrap 95% across seeds, egos within a run not independent); sweep C wording "holds the offered traffic population, spawn schedule, and actor-crossing workload fixed"; per-count success percentages instead of "between 8 of 10 and 19 of 20"; p99 stated in edge cycles (two, two, three, five); one contributions sentence (state movement scales with crossing actors, not consumers) and the sweep L knee tied to the capacity figure. Measured version must compute intervals the same way (lander contract unchanged; the statistic is in plot_figures).
- EPOCH FENCE CORRECTION (writing session): a planner-side "highest epoch seen, skip lower" rule cannot fire under delivery-by-binding (a source-bound planner never receives the destination's e+1; it keeps consuming the source's coasting x under e = a stale-owner consumption by the [CONSUMEDEPOCH] definition). EPOCH_FENCE=1 must be SOURCE-SIDE: the publish path consults ownership (source_commit -> publishable=False) and drops committed-away tracks from the source's delivered set, i.e. the design's original "the source stops publishing the previous epoch"; both-emit window then = commit-propagation delay, not tracker coast. Stamp + planner-side rule kept as belt-and-braces. EPOCH_FENCE=0 = today's share-and-keep-publishing = the measured "off" arm. Flow blocks unaffected either way (ego bound to the destination). Eval session's scenario caveat accepted: the single-crossing flow faults scene yields 0/0 in both arms (clean negative, reported as such); the off > 0 / on = 0 contrast comes from the CORRIDOR: add Khonsu at EPOCH_FENCE=0 (10 routes) beside the six fence-on arms; lander emits stale_owner_consumed + both-emit window per route. NOTE: the fork's c869199 COMMIT-step text describes the source continuing to publish after commit; with the source gate on for the corridor and faults blocks, that sentence must be re-checked when those blocks land (source publication ends at commit acknowledgement, not at tracker loss).
- PAPER c869199 (fork): design (c) resolved: COMMIT step states the built source behavior (source keeps tracking and serving its own bound vehicles after commit, publication no longer the owner's, ends when its tracker loses the actor; one locale's forecasts per vehicle; both-emit window measured in the fault table; superseded owner not consumed because the planner keeps the highest epoch); epoch paragraph adds "in the evaluated implementation the planner applies this ownership check to every forecast it receives". No PENDING comments remain in design.tex. 28 pp main / 26 mock.
- EPOCH FENCE BUILD (eval session): behavior_agent_1k_epoch.py keeps the highest consumed owner_epoch per actor and skips lower; [CONSUMEDEPOCH] gains a fenced flag; smoke = one flow cell (fence dormant, byte-identical) + one corridor route (fence active at the 2nd crossing); switch only blocks not started: FDE subset, freshness, T25b, band, load, theta on the current overlay; faults, repl_period, probe, corridor on the fenced overlay (recorded per block). DECISION: fence is a knob EPOCH_FENCE (1 default; 0 = stamp + logging on, skip off) so the faults block runs epoch check off and on on ONE overlay version (the table's two columns from one tag); schema faults row maps epochs on/off to EPOCH_FENCE.
- DECK v49 PUSHED (Sep 8 20:07; lock cleared; pre-check remote == v46 held through the lock; now remote == verify_v49). TYLER "go ahead" (Sep 8 ~20:05) taken as: (1) IMPLEMENT the epoch claim in 1l: stamp + planner-side fence (highest epoch per actor, lower ignored) in the _epoch overlay, smoke on one flow cell (byte-identical expected) and one corridor route (fence exercised at the 2nd crossing), switch only the blocks not yet started; REQUIRED before the faults and corridor blocks; FDE subset and earlier non-central blocks may run on the current overlay; overlay version per block recorded in the KB; source-side share-and-keep-publishing stays as built (described as the measured double-emission window). (2) Two-ego measured run is POST-DEADLINE; the multi-ego block ships projected; per-ego runner/landers stay on the post-deadline list; [CONSUMEDEPOCH] + delivery-kb logging kept. Fork ordered to resolve the (c) PENDING comments in design.tex with the built source behavior and keep the epoch sentences.
- PAPER 4988caa: fig_multiego row titles fixed (rendered check clean). DECK v49 BUILT (257ef32; 40 slides; multi-ego slide rendered clean), PUSH HELD: OneDrive 423 Locked since ~17:46 (Tyler has the file open); remote == v46; v47, v48, v49 are committed in the repo and verify_v49.pptx is the file to push when the lock clears (pre-check: remote must still equal verify_v46).
- PAPER 8b3b926 + 148ce31 (fork): MULTI-EGO BLOCK projected (gen_multiego; frozengen_multiego_rows.csv 900 rows, frozengen_multiego_handoffs.csv 4230 rows; fig_multiego figure* 2x3; tab_multiego decomposition at 1 vs 8 egos; §5.7 paragraphs per sweep; RQ4 map; scaffold 12b; 7 rules; compliance intervals are 95% across egos, not Wilson over pooled decisions). Macros Me*: sweep C Khonsu compliance 98 -> 97%, PREPARE/COMMIT 1.00 per crossing at 1 and 8 egos, migration 1.4 KB flat, compute 92.9 -> 94.7 ms, delivery 16 -> 127 KB, stale 0, per-ego success 8/10 .. 19/20; sweep L Khonsu 99/99/97/92, reactive 70 -> 48, repl_final 78 at 4 / 62 at 8, p99 404/389/599/1004 ms, p50 ~189. DESIGN (148ce31): planners consume from their position-bound locale only; migrating actor visible at COMMIT (shadow + publish gate); source forwarding does not exist. (c) PENDING: audit list of epoch-fence claims = design.tex:26-28, :124-125, :141-145, :231; introduction.tex:132, :149; appendix.tex:16-21; evaluation.tex:1099-1108, :704, :793-797, :827, :983, :1021. 28 pp main / 26 mock. DECK: multi-ego slide added (title "Adding planners moves no extra state, adding vehicles reaches the capacity knee", status Needed, RQ4; title semicolon assertion added to the builder; sync list includes fig_multiego); fig_multiego row labels clipped -> fix ordered; deck v49 rebuild + push after the fix (OneDrive still locked, remote == v46). Eval session: epoch/delivery-kb edits in separate _epoch overlay files, live overlay unchanged until the byte-identical smoke.
- 1l LOG-ONLY EPOCH WORK (eval session building): owner epoch stamped on every published ObstaclePrediction (dynamic attribute), [CONSUMEDEPOCH] per (ego, actor, decision) joined post hoc against the committed-epoch timeline for stale_owner_consumed, forecast_delivery_kb accounting in _deliver_predictions; no planner fence (Tyler's call). GUARD (writing session): the edited overlay is staged separately and the runners switch to it only after a one-cell byte-identical smoke (RUNROW/HANDOFFROW/launch tick vs the same seed on the current overlay); if no Atlas window before the FDE subset, the subset runs on the current overlay and the non-central blocks pick up the edited one after the smoke on cetus; the corridor carries it only after the same smoke.
- CROSS-LOCALE FORECAST ARCHITECTURE AS BUILT (eval session, file:line): (a) a CV planner consumes ONLY its position-bound locale's forecasts (_deliver_predictions sets vm.agent.edge_predictions for managed VMs only, edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py:485-499; planner merges one stream + local sensing, behavior_agent.py:373-399; VM moves at the boundary via daemon.request_handoff, daemon.py:91,120). (b) a C-bound planner gets a B-owned actor x only at COMMIT: PREPARE imports x as a suppressed shadow (_shadow_obstacles, daemon.py:276-283), the publish gate drops shadowed tracks ([PUBGATE] :776-793), no B->C forwarding; COMMIT clears the shadow (runner_corridor_1l.py:413-414). (c) DISCREPANCY WITH THE PAPER: after COMMIT the source B keeps publishing x to its own bound vehicles from its own tracker until coast/max_time_lost (transfer is a SHARE: "source keeps tracking concurrently", edge_manager_pluggable_base.py:508-523); source_commit sets publishable=False in ownership state only (ownership.py:77-81), a MEASUREMENT marker (publishable_epochs, double-publish/fault eval), not consulted by publish/deliver; ObstaclePrediction carries source_tick/publish_tick/probability, NO epoch or owner; no planner-side epoch fence exists (moot by binding: a planner never sees two streams). The paper (design.tex:140 "Every published forecast carries the actor's stable ID and ownership epoch"; deck "planners accept only the highest") is NOT backed. (d) 10 m overlap: C tracks x locally only near x >= 205 (RSU1 [305,205], lidar 100 m: marginal); local track carla_id -1; identity at commit = exclusive position-nearest (_stamp_nearest_tracklet :345-381), migrated id preserved; transient migrated+local duplicate until association merges. DECISION FOR TYLER: implement the claim in 1l (epoch stamped on published forecasts + planner accepts only the highest epoch for an actor; faults and corridor blocks then run on it) or describe the built behavior (delivery by binding; source continues serving its bound vehicles from its local track after commit = the measured double-emission window). Ordered regardless: epoch stamp on published predictions + per-(ego, actor, decision) consumed-vs-committed epoch log + forecast_delivery_kb byte accounting in 1l before faults/corridor run (log-only, smoke byte-identical). MULTI-EGO ESTIMATE: 2nd ego supported (sim_api.py:1599-1611, real WF client, exclude_managed); runner and landers must become per-ego; stale_owner_consumed and forecast_delivery_kb need new logging (as expected); promoted stream vehicle = base point of BOTH sweeps at ego_count 2; build 25-33 h (3.5-4.5 days) + 60 runs ~7.5 h; 4 egos do NOT fit the ~420 m drivable straight (route independence lost); Town06/04 needed for 4. Tyler decides.
- NON-CENTRAL REFINEMENTS IN (eval session): probe on openscenario_1_flow_realfusion_gt (separate config); [DUALROW] log-only band instrumentation + band lander emitting dual_* and the CROSSROW seconds breakdown (de345090); FRESHNESS_ACCEL computed at freshness start (lowest sweep level with warm >= 8/10 and kf <= 3/10, fallback 3). Non-central runner relaunched clean, one instance queued behind the FDE subset. Multi-ego feasibility estimate in flight against the lander contract (per-column emittable-today vs new logging; promoted stream vehicle realizes both sweeps at ego_count = 2).
- MULTI-EGO BLOCK ORDERED AS PROJECTED (Tyler: "Create a generator for this experiment as well, for the data, and the following graph, and insert a part into the paper and the powerpoint"): two sweeps on the four-locale corridor with 1/2/4/8 planner-controlled egos on staggered routes: C = consumers (fixed physical scene) and L = load (egos added as actors); arms reactive, Khonsu, repl_final; 10 paired seeds. Landers: frozen<tag>_multiego_rows.csv (per ego per run: STD + sweep, ego_count, ego_id, route_success, compliance_frac, warm_frac, stale_owner_consumed, binding_changes, decisions; run-level migration_kb_per_crossing, forecast_delivery_kb, track_pred_ms_per_cycle, actor_crossings) and frozen<tag>_multiego_handoffs.csv (per actor handoff: prepares, commits, bytes, prepare_to_ready_ms, consumers). Expected shapes (reviewer): C = Khonsu compliance ~0.99 -> ~0.97 flat within Wilson, migration KB flat 1.4, one PREPARE/COMMIT per actor crossing at any ego count, compute nearly flat, forecast delivery bytes linear, stale-owner consumed exactly 0, per-ego success ~0.88 noisy; L = Khonsu 0.99/0.99/0.97/0.92 (knee at 8), reactive 0.70/0.68/0.60/0.48, repl_final 0.90/0.88/0.78/0.62, p50 flat ~200, p95 +1 cycle 4->8, p99 stair 400/400/600/1000. Figure fig_multiego (figure*, 2 x 3), table tab_multiego (decomposition at 1 vs 8 egos), §5.7 paragraphs, RQ4 mapping, scaffold entry 12b, rules. Design-section sentence on cross-locale forecast access left PENDING until the code answer. Deck slide follows the paper landing. Measured version depends on the eval session's 2-ego feasibility estimate (4/8 egos likely do not fit the 500 m reduced corridor).
- MULTI-EGO QUESTION (Tyler + reviewer, Sep 8 evening): NO multi-ego, multi-locale test exists. Every closed-loop scenario has one planner-controlled ego; oncoming are GT-injected obstacles (not connected vehicles; live radio n_cav ~1); Table 13's "Connected actors 50%" is the projected corridor spec, not the built reduced corridor. eCAV supports multiple vehicle clients (distributed actors), so it is not architecturally blocked. Reviewer's architectural question (how a planner bound to C gets a forecast for an actor owned by B before it crosses) must be answered as built: expected answer = the planner consumes its bound locale's forecasts only and receives x under C's epoch at COMMIT (no cross-locale forwarding; C's prepared state is suppressed by design); code confirmation + shadow semantics requested from the eval session. Feasibility estimate requested for the smallest real test: 2 egos on the built corridor (westbound ego + one eastbound stream vehicle made a connected planner-controlled ego), shared actor relevant to both, arms reactive/Khonsu/repl_final x10, per-ego route success + compliance, per planner x actor x tick owner epoch consumed (stale must be zero), p99 prepare-to-ready under two consumers; 4 egos likely do not fit the 500 m straight. Planning only; corridor smoke and 1l chain keep priority; Tyler decides on the estimate.
- PAPER b95123c (fork): reviewer pass 12 applied (conclusion two conditions; intro ten-frame sentence; §5.3 regions qualified to the maneuvering actor + Fig 6 caption; §2.3 cold-start sentence; Table 7 caption "constant-velocity"; "why the full record migrates" sentence at 1.25 KB; audit fixed §5.3 method + regions prose and §2.4; §5.7 Kalman bridge 9 -> 15 of 40; loaded paragraph timing-not-content; abstract "approximately constant", 193 words). DECK v48 BUILT, PUSH HELD (OneDrive still 423 Locked; remote == v46): regions slide bullets ("Constant motion: a velocity snapshot suffices over the tested range" / maneuvering three regions / Khonsu holds), regions + takeaway + ladder notes aligned; two-locale slide title shortened to "...is enough" (transplant alias updated). Repo commits 3fbbc8d + alias commit. Eval session confirmed: probe-specific YAML, [DUALROW] log-only instrumentation + CROSSROW breakdown in the band lander, FRESHNESS_ACCEL read at freshness start from the accel sweep's separating level (fallback 3, logged).
- NON-CENTRAL RUNNER QUEUED (eval session, landers caf3fe7b): Atlas chain by done-markers: central -> a=0.5 -> FDE subset -> freshness (280 runs: 25/level at 200-500 ms, 10 at 0/100/600/800, flow + accel) -> T25b -> band+dual -> load -> theta+p_dst -> faults -> repl_period -> real-fusion probe. DECISIONS: (1) probe uses a separate scenario config (flags false) not a sed on the shared YAML (crash would leave the flags flipped); fallback sed + EXIT trap + post-block assertion. (2) band dual_* columns: add log-only dual-compute instrumentation to the overlay and smoke one band cell at a block boundary; if not smoked before the band block starts, run with blanks (Fig 10 compute panel + Fig 11 stay generated with the limitation); emit the [CROSSROW] breakdown in the band lander for Table 12. (3) freshness accel level = the accel sweep's separating level (lowest with warm >= 8/10 and kf <= 3/10), chosen after the sweep lands; default 3 if none separates.
- REVIEWER PASS 12 (Tyler pasted, Sep 8 evening): the Kalman -> history -> preparation ladder is now internally consistent on the data (Fig 4 KF exact at constant speed, SSM 1.9-3x lower under maneuvers; Fig 6 KF no constant-speed cliff, transition ~2.8 s maneuvering; headline 20/20 for every velocity-carrying arm; corridor KF 9/40 vs Khonsu 35/40 because motion changes at crossings). Five prose remnants of the old "history always required" framing ordered fixed: conclusion (drop "and the destination has time to observe it"; two independent conditions: motion changes -> temporal history; T_avail < T_reactive -> prepare early), intro ten-frame sentence (shorter history or CV forecast before two seconds), §5.3 three-regions sentence qualified to the maneuvering actor, §2.3 cold-start sentence (a cold-start track begins without velocity; a migrated snapshot arrives with it), Table 7 caption "constant-velocity". Plus: "why migrate ten frames" sentence (preserves forecast quality across motion changes, avoids predicting which reduced record suffices, 1.25 KB), audit of "history after every crossing"/"snapshot needs time to observe"/"ten frames required"/"SSM state must migrate" sentences, §5.7 bridge (Kalman warm on every crossing yet 9/40: warm state is not adequate state), loaded paragraph (reactive fails on timing, not content), abstract "approximately constant". Reviewer also flagged the two-frame result as a reviewer question the paper must answer explicitly (done via item 6).
- PAPER 39dc771: Fig 4 layout fixed (y labels on their own rows, legend two rows of four; rendered check clean). DECK v47 BUILT, PUSH HELD (OneDrive 423 Locked again at ~18:40; remote == v46): Kalman slide bullets/notes on KfOneStep*/SsmOneStep*/ratio/peak macros; figure re-synced. Last verified push = verify_v46.pptx; v47 committed in the repo (888accc), retry when the lock clears. Paper state: measured = headline (20 seeds), trigger (20 seeds), record ablation (6 rows), collision partners + cold mechanism, top-mode paragraph, Table 6, Fig 4, Fig 5, canvas, Multi-V2X distribution, association appendix (isolated); projected = regions (T25 rerun ~Sep 9 08:30), maneuvering panel (accel sweep ~Sep 9 21:30), loaded n31/n20 (~Sep 10 10:30), Table 5 FDE (six-mode subset after a=0.5), freshness, T25b, overlap/band/dual, load, theta trace, faults, netem, density/burst (cetus tail), corridor (built, smoke at the T25 landing), sizing.
- PAPER cb10a57 + 5915b0e (fork): Datasets/Platforms paragraphs describe the parametric maneuver trajectories (V2X-Seq/DAIR-V2X out of Datasets, kept in related work); Fig 4 measured from the re-landed microbench_kf_vs_ssm.csv (two columns, velocity error top, one-step below, KF dashed / SSM solid, pre-onset shaded, no intervals); macros KfOneStep*/SsmOneStep*/KfVelPeak*/SsmVelPeak*/KfSsmOneStepRatio* (straight 0.001/0.026; turn 0.546/0.285 ratio 1.9; brake 0.349/0.117 ratio 3.0; lane change 0.128/0.052 ratio 2.4; velocity peaks turn 7.3/9.2, brake 4.6/2.6, lane change 2.2/2.0); §5.2 states the seeding, the [0, 2] s window, and that under the turn the velocity error is similar for both while the one-step error halves. Rules 267/267. Rendered-page check by the writing session: left-column y labels clipped/colliding -> fix ordered (constrained layout, shorter label, two-row legend). Deck v47 built with the Kalman slide bullets and notes on the new macros; push waits for the fixed figure.
- FRESHNESS SWEEP APPROVED (Tyler, Sep 8: "if freshness sweep will help, do it"): AOI_INJECT_MS injected-delay sweep runs FIRST in the non-central order (before T25b), 25 runs per level near the transition, both scenarios, -> frozen1l_age_sweep_rows.csv (schema row 47, realized_age_ms = total age at use). Tyler also asked whether the corridor is being done: yes, built (a193fc0f family), smoke staged for the T25 rerun landing on cetus (tail held for one route), 60 routes after the tail. FIG 4 RE-LANDED (d311c179): KF seeded with velocity from the first two detections, matching the closed-loop snapshot arm (ab3dmot_state_transfer.py:91 exports kf.x incl. x[7:10] + P, :134-135 restores verbatim); frame 1 dropped for both arms; means over t in [0, 2] s (41 samples) identical to before: one-step straight 0.001/0.026, turn 0.546/0.285, brake 0.349/0.117, lane change 0.128/0.052 (KF/SSM); vel_err 0.008/0.523, 5.499/5.705, 3.509/2.339, 1.285/1.046. Fork stopped on a monthly credit limit mid-task with the Fig 4 swap + datasets edit uncommitted in the paper checkout; resumed after Tyler restored credits with the re-landed file.
- REPLAY DATASET (eval session, from code): harness.py:80-157 generates the four maneuvers in closed form (v = 20 m/s, turn R = 30 m, brake -8 m/s^2, lane change 3.5 m sigmoid); no V2X-Seq loader anywhere; the paper's Datasets sentence was unbacked. V2X-Seq TFD is on disk unextracted (~/Downloads, 1.39 GB, 10 Hz); a re-land = extract + loader + resample + box conversion + kinematic maneuver classification + replay + KF adapter + bootstrap CIs, 1-2 days. DECISION (writing session, (a)): the paper describes the harness as built ("parametric maneuver trajectories", four parameters, deterministic, one trajectory per maneuver); V2X-Seq/DAIR-V2X leave the Datasets paragraph (stay in related work); V2X-Seq re-land goes on the POST-DEADLINE list (dissertation quality). FIG 4 MEASURED (75a2903c; generator gen_kf_vs_ssm.py 25623cd4): real filterpy KF (AB3DMOT dim_x=10 CV) vs SSM on identical detections; mean one-step error over the maneuver window: straight KF 0.001 / SSM 0.026; turn 0.546 / 0.285; brake 0.349 / 0.117; lane change 0.128 / 0.052 m -> KF near exact on straight, SSM 2-3x lower under maneuvers (CV velocity lags the maneuver). First rows carry a KF init transient (t = -0.45 s, vel_err 20 m/s); windows + KF initialization asked of the eval session; fork ordered to swap Fig 4 to the file with stated windows and to fix the Datasets/Platforms paragraphs.
- PAPER f6d2c15 (fork): Table 6 (gen_tab_micro from microbench_onestep.csv; turn/brake/lane-change one-frame and cold values moved a few cm from the transcription) and Fig 5 (microbench_history_depth.csv, one-step error, no intervals) measured; §5.2 depth sentences rewritten to the two-frame knee ("three to twenty times above the deeper records"; CV fallback below five frames; learned model engages at five and adds a small error; matches the closed-loop record ablation); Depth<Maneuver><Depth> macros; rules 277/277. DECK v46 PUSHED (pre-check remote == v45): figs/make_micro_png.py reads microbench_onestep.csv; forced-handoff slide bullet "one frame and cold start: 20 to 29 cm"; notes carry the straight-trajectory depth values and the two-frame knee. Last verified push = verify_v46.pptx.
- DECK v45 PUSHED (retry after the lock cleared; remote == verify_v45). PAPER d96339f + f6a585e (fork, before a rate-limit stop): Table 6 quantity fixed to the tracker's one-step error vs GT, readers ready for one_step_err_m; top-mode paragraph now measured from frozen1k_topmode_rows.csv. REPLAY BLOCK (eval session): harness.py hardcodes Mamba3DTracker; its "Kalman (B1)" arm is the SSM at depth 1, NOT a Kalman filter (relabel refused, correctly); a real filterpy KF exists (AB3DMOTWrapper, dim_x=10 CV) needing a ~40-line adapter -> DECISION: build it (fair Kalman baseline on identical detections), land microbench_kf_vs_ssm.csv. Landed measured (12e86638, generator 8932a8eb): microbench_onestep.csv (Table 6) + microbench_history_depth.csv (Fig 5) with one_step_err_m; DETERMINISTIC (one track, seed 1 per cell; no intervals). FINDING: depth curve non-monotone on straight: 0 -> 0.25, 1 -> 0.205, 2 -> 0.009, 5 -> 0.021, 10 -> 0.027 m; below enable_time_thresh=5 the tracker's CV fallback is near-exact on clean input; the learned model engages at 5 and adds a small error. Knee at TWO frames, consistent with the closed-loop record ablation (one frame 9/10, two+ 10/10). Paper wording ordered to the measured shape; the "knee at five" claims come out. OPEN: the paper says V2X-Seq recorded tracks feed the forced-handoff replay; the eval session says the harness runs fixed synthetic trajectories -> feasibility of running the harness on V2X-Seq tracks asked (real noise, real maneuvers, many tracks -> bootstrap intervals); if feasible the whole replay block re-lands on them; if not, the paper text changes. CORRIDOR BUILT (a193fc0f family: scenario_1_corridor.xml/.py, openscenario_1_corridor_gt.yaml, khonsu_corridor_land.py, runner_corridor_1l.py): next-hop helper, per-crossing re-arm keyed (nid, src_lid), epoch/shadow readback + [CORRIDORCROSS] rows; run-time risks flagged (conflict-1 oncoming presence, WF anchors at y=205 unvalidated, westbound lane to x=-80). SMOKE PLACEMENT DECISION: option (1): hold the cetus tail when the T25 rerun lands, deploy the corridor overlay, one-route smoke, release the tail regardless; re-smoke at tail block boundaries if it fails; 60-route block after the tail.
- DECK v45 BUILT, PUSH HELD (17:46): pre-check passed (remote == v44) but OneDrive returned HTTP 423 Locked (the file is open on Tyler's side). Local repo pptx = v45 (committed), verify_v45.pptx in the scratchpad; remote stays v44. Rule: retry only when the lock clears AND remote still == v44; if Tyler saved edits, diff by slide title and port first. v45 content: notes say FDE; forced-handoff note and figs/real_micro.png relabeled as the tracker's one-step position error against ground truth. Eval session: FDE recompute artifacts moved to the sandbox KB (8c904cb1); replay block on the harness one-step quantity delegated with a blocker check (Kalman + SSM on identical observations); column name one_step_err_m in microbench_kf_vs_ssm.csv, microbench_history_depth.csv, microbench_onestep.csv.
- MICROBENCH (Table 6) DIAGNOSIS (eval session): the forced-handoff harness (ecav/core/application/edge/migration/harness.py) measures the MEAN over the first five post-handoff frames of the tracker's ONE-STEP-AHEAD (50 ms) xy error vs GROUND TRUTH (FrameResult.error_xy, :183-189); measured_microbench.csv reproduces to 3 decimals. evaluation.tex:221 wrongly says the reference is the source's pre-handoff forecast. A 5 s open-loop FDE recompute (13.7 m straight for the learned rollout vs 0.32 m CV; turn/brake inverted) is model drift with no predictor in the loop and is NOT a paper quantity (artifacts moved to the sandbox KB as diagnostics). DECISION (writing session, (a)): Table 6 = post-handoff one-step tracking-recovery error vs GT (tracker-state quantity, like velocity error; never called displacement error or FDE); the whole replay block becomes measured on that quantity: harness runs ordered offline for Fig 4 (kalman vs ssm: vel_err + one-step error around maneuver onset) and Fig 5 (depth 0/1/2/5/10 one-step error) landing as the existing file names in the sandbox KB; paper readers switch from fde5_m to the one-step column when they land. Fork ordered: fix the reference sentence, captions, metrics paragraph sentence distinguishing the two measures.
- CORRIDOR PLAN (eval session, code-verified): the migration library is N-locale-clean (LocaleRouter/LocaleRegistry scan all locales, registry.py:61-94; edge_list loop flow_gt:127-153; sim_api.py:1560 builds edge+RSUs per entry; ownership/epoch/shadow per track; the EGO chains natively via the locale tracker). Two-locale assumptions are confined to the flow runner's OBSTACLE path: flow_gt:536 dst_lid = next(l != src), :491-492 final-sync src heuristic, :456/:671 npc_handoff_done one-shot latch (kills the 2nd crossing). Town01's usable straight is ~515 m -> a literal 900 m (3 x 300) does not fit; REDUCED corridor fits: locale_0 x[200,330], locale_1 x[70,210], locale_2 x[-90,80] (10 m overlaps), ego spawns x317 west, oncoming x-190 east. Cost: 6 arms x 10 seeds = 60 routes, ~6.3 min/route -> ~6.3 h + CARLA teardown on cetus (3 concurrent edges = compute risk). Build ~17.5 h itemized (geometry 3, next-hop helper 2.5, obstacle chaining 3.5, landers 3.5, debug + 1-route smoke 5) = 2-2.5 days. DECISION (writing session): reduced Town01, GO; the paper describes locale length as set by the map's straight, not the fusion bound. Smoke must show the 2nd crossing's epoch increment + fresh shadow.
- PAPER 1003760 (fork): FDE rule applied: metrics paragraph defines FDE once (over the two highest-scoring modes, the smaller at the horizon; top-mode FDE where degeneracy is discussed); ADE/minADE/minFDE/miss rate gone; Table 5 = Arm + FDE 5 s (fde5_m/fde3_m/fde5_top_m; reader takes frozen1l_fde_rows.csv first); Table 7 header, Fig 5 label, prose, design.tex renamed; Table 6 quantity = "error of the destination's forecast against the source's" pending measured_microbench_fde.csv; new §5.2 frozen-top-mode paragraph (PROJECTED until frozen1k_topmode_rows.csv lands; TopFrozen* macros, rules 10-30% and completed-collided gap <= 10 pts). Rules 268/268; main 27 pp, mock 25 pp. Deck: two notes renamed to FDE (uncommitted); micro figure label "post-handoff displacement error (m)" waits for the microbench quantity answer, then one rebuild (v45).
- CORRIDOR DECISION (Tyler, Sep 8): "We need to do this, and it's definitely not 3 days." BUILD the reduced corridor: three locales along the existing flow arterial (second boundary along x, same oncoming pattern; new map only if the road is too short), two crossings per route, arms cold, reactive, Khonsu, continuous replication, repl_final, kf_final, 10 seeds at one traffic level; landers = corridor rows (route success, warm_frac, compliance_frac, bytes_per_crossing) + crossing index; timeline only if free. Build plan from the code ordered within the hour (two-locale assumptions, LocaleRouter/edge_list N=3, chaining across two boundaries, geometry, cost per route on cetus, itemized hours). Runs on cetus after its tail; Atlas central blocks untouched. Freshness injected-delay sweep decision still pending.
- METRIC RULE (Tyler, Sep 8): "It should be FDE. But you still have it in the slides." Prediction-quality metric = FDE, named FDE, paper and deck; no generic displacement error, no ADE/minADE/minFDE/miss rate. FROZEN TOP MODE VERDICT (eval session order 2): three consumers in behavior_agent_1k.py: hazard pass = live positions (720-745); crossing-path collision check = top-K modes, prediction_mode_top_k=2 with top-mode fallback (839-862); overtake go/no-go + per-tick recheck = near anchor predicted_trajectory[0] + tracker KF speed obs.kf_speed_mps (1092-1168). Frozen-top-mode rate (endpoint <1 m over 5 s while the actor moves >10 m), 1k headline r1-20: warm 17.7%, kf 16.2%, edgewarp 20.6%, reactive 18.4%, cold 21.9% (23.8 completed vs 21.8 collided), handover 16.9%; uncorrelated with outcome -> predictor-quality observation, NOT a driver. ORDERS: eval = order 1 unheld as FDE over the two highest-scoring modes (smaller at the horizon) + top-mode FDE diagnostic (frozen1l_fde_rows.csv: fde5_m, fde3_m, fde5_top_m; 30 runs after a=0.5); microbench quantity check and recompute as 5 s FDE (measured_microbench_fde.csv, offline); frozen1k_topmode_rows.csv for macros. Fork = FDE renaming everywhere, metrics paragraph defines FDE once, Table 5 -> Arm + FDE 5 s, Table 6 caption pending the recompute, frozen-top-mode paragraph in §5.2 from data. Deck notes renamed to FDE (rebuild after the microbench label lands; make_micro_png.py label "post-handoff displacement error (m)" pending the recompute).
- FRESHNESS SWEEP GATE: the controlled freshness sweep = AOI_INJECT_MS injected delay (behavior_agent_1k.py:334 in the 1l overlay, [AOIROW]); Tyler's standing rule: age at use comes through ns-3, injected-delay experiment only if he decides (evaluation.tex comment "The controlled sweep is his pending decision"). The reviewer praised the controlled sweep. Question put to Tyler; the eval session moves freshness to the END of the non-central order (T25b, band+dual, load, theta+p_dst, faults, repl_period, real-fusion probe, then freshness if approved). Load block (panel B, ns-3 at N = 4/12/20/31) is not gated. Atlas queue: central -> a=0.5 -> six-mode subset -> non-central.
- FDE RECONCILIATION (eval session, code-verified): the record-ablation diag fde3/fde5 = run-MEAN of the TOP-MODE final displacement error (world frame, same carla_id at t+h, all forecast blocks, no unit or frame bug), ~50 m because the TOP MODE IS FREQUENTLY FROZEN/DEGENERATE (e.g. gid 200 tick 97: endpoint fixed at x~264 while the truth moves 208->240); recompute on the 1k headline at 5 s: warm 49.4, kf 53.9, edgewarp 48.5, reactive 48.8, cold 46.8, handover 55.7 m. Table 5's minFDE 0.6-1.6 m is PROJECTED (hardcoded in make_mock_data gen_fde_rows) and CANNOT be computed from the 1k logs (the EVAL dump carries only the top mode). Decisions: diag FDE stays out of the paper; six-mode endpoint logging added to the 1l overlay (logging only); 30-run subset (6 arms x 5 seeds, flow @12) queued after a=0.5, before the non-central campaign -> frozen1l_fde_rows.csv (minFDE/minADE over six modes at 3/5 s over the first five post-commit refreshes, top-mode FDE, miss rate); Table 5 swaps when it lands. OPEN (ordered before the subset runs): what the ego planner consumes (top mode / all modes / CV coast) and the per-arm frozen-top-mode rate in the headline block; if the planner consumes the top mode, the paper must state that outcomes were reached with a degenerate forecast a fraction of the time and why they still separate. No predictor code change before the diagnosis.
- TYLER RULE (Sep 8): his \tl{} notes are commented out of EVERY build (cmds.tex: \tl is a no-op; \ad/\KR/\ptag stay gated by \ifshowcomments: main on, main_mock off). Paper dfd0732: main 27 pp Tyler=0 Intent=83; mock 25 pp all zero; §5.5 long-lead sentence measured: no duplicate destination track at any tested lead (HANDOFFROW re-prepares 0/20 at 2/3/4 s; warm_before_first_use YES for every prepared oncoming; the ~4-5 track_ids per carla_id is baseline re-ID churn, identical across leads). Tyler asked why khonsu_story was not updated: OneDrive remote == verify_v43 (pushed 16:36), three pushes today (v41 13:15, v42 14:46, v43 16:36); v44 pushed now with the mechanism note corrected to position-gate association. Eval session: REPL_PERIOD_S 0.2 = edge_dt (5 Hz) confirmed; repl-period sweep queued after faults; real-fusion sanity = one-cell WF detection probe after association (WF live-detection wall risk), 15-run block only if it detects.
- REPO RECONCILED (eval session): frozen1l_assoc_rows.csv committed (165683c4); local == origin; the stray unstaged ecav/core/prediction/mtr_edge_predictor.py (freeze-1k CVSWITCH + fair-Kalman code bled into the main checkout; belongs to the idfix_wt overlay) is stashed pathspec-scoped as stash@{0} "stray freeze-1k mtr bleed" (recoverable). Both sessions commit with explicit pathspecs from now on. t8 tail FIXED before start: EdgeWarp arm = edgewarp_full (full record + predictive trigger), tag token "edgewarp" kept for make_floats/multicross readers; old queued tail killed, v2 re-queued behind the T25 rerun. FDE reconciliation running; duplicates per lead, replication-period sweep, real-fusion estimate next.
- PAPER 5f90f7f (fork): association rewritten to the measured system (§3 step 5, §4 Import, §5.5 long-lead sentence with PENDING duplicate count, §7 limitations, appendix A.2 as the isolated harness on the production association function reading frozen1l_assoc_rows.csv: identity 1.00, geometry 1.00 @0, 0.72 @1 m, 0.12-0.20 @2 m, 0.05-0.12 @3.5 m); \ifshowcomments in cmds.tex (main on: 27 pp, 44 Tyler boxes; main_mock off: 25 pp, zero Tyler/Alex/Kishore/Intent); Diag FDE sentences commented out PENDING reconciliation ("Record depth changes forecast error but not first-use time"); EdgeWarp payload named in Tables 5/7/15 captions; §2.3 overlap sentence; replication wording (similar route success 37 vs 35 of 40; 86% vs 96% route-wide compliance; 156.2 vs 1.4 KB); compliance denominators; density paragraph opener; contribution 2; 5 Hz cadence statement; ABSTRACT rewritten to the five-move candidate, 191 words in the mock build, CoBytesRatioReplKhonsu = 110. Audit: discussion.tex and architecture.tex are not input by main.tex (stale files with old identity claims; not rendered). Rules 261/261.
- REVIEWER PASS 11 (Tyler pasted; "major improvement", story clean): priority = remove rendered Tyler comments (48) -> reconcile data/baseline inconsistencies -> resolve or delete the 40-74 m record-ablation FDE numbers (vs Table 5 minFDE 0.6-1.6 m) -> identity association -> trim to 12 pages (~50% cut, floats to appendix, Fig 17 out, Fig 8 fewer triggers). Also: §2.3 categorical sensing sentence conflicts with §2.2/§5.6 (reviewer wording adopted); replication-frequency objection (add a period sweep; state 5 Hz is the track cadence); "matches Khonsu" -> "similar route success, 161.7 vs 1.4 KB"; compliance denominators; flatten three sentences; contribution 2 repetition; EdgeWarp payload named per table (Table 5 full record; Table 15 snapshot -> 1k rerun full). Reviewer praised the corridor numbers, which are PROJECTED (no runner; Tyler decision pending). ABSTRACT REVIEW (Tyler pasted): 289 -> 170-190 words, five moves, drop the dense-radio result, add the replication cost ratio; candidate text adopted verbatim with macros. ORDERS: fork = comment toggle (\ifshowcomments; main true, main_mock false), Diag FDE sentences commented out PENDING, EdgeWarp captions, §2.3 sentence, wording fixes, limitations identity paragraph, abstract rewrite (+ CoBytesRatioReplKhonsu macro); eval session = FDE definition reconciliation (fde3/fde5 vs Table 5 minFDE on the same runs), t8 EdgeWarp -> edgewarp_full before the tail starts, repl_final period sweep {0.2,0.5,1,2} x10 -> frozen1l_repl_period_rows.csv, real-fusion sanity block feasibility estimate. Trim plan written: scale_out_nsdi/docs/trim_plan_2026-09-15.md (execute after the data freeze).
- ASSOCIATION FINDINGS (eval session, harness scripts/khonsu_assoc_trial.py calling AB3DMOT_libs.matching.data_association -> compute_affinity UNCHANGED at 24f83c9f; 1200 rows -> frozen1l_assoc_rows.csv; stable_id 1.00 everywhere; geometry 1.00 @0 m, 0.72 @1 m, 0.12-0.20 @2 m, 0.05-0.12 @3.5 m, modest distractor effect): (1) STABLE-ID MERGE IS DORMANT IN THE LIVE CLOSED LOOP: compute_affinity reads det.info[CID] but AB3DMOT.process_dets never sets det.info -> det_cid = -1 -> production detection-to-track association is PURE GEOMETRY (8 m gate on the predicted position); the migrated track keeps its carla_id, but no closed-loop result used identity-keyed detection merging. (2) INVERTED FORBID: compute_affinity sets COST_MAX=+1e3 for a conflicting identity while data_association MAXIMIZES affinity, so an identity-carrying distractor would be preferred; harness distractors are anonymous so the figure is unaffected. DECISION (writing session, (b)): paper describes the measured system (geometry-only live association; identity merge = designed path exercised in isolation); fork ordered to rewrite design.tex:172, implementation.tex:69/77, evaluation.tex §5.5 long-lead sentence (PENDING duplicate count per lead, requested from the eval session), limitations.tex:22, appendix A.2 + assoc reader. POST-DEADLINE LIST: propagate det.info in process_dets; fix the inverted identity-conflict cost; re-validate closed-loop blocks that lean on identity. No 1l code change.
- ACCEL SWEEP VALID (GT 2nd-order fit on positions, deterministic across arms at fixed seed): commanded 2 -> GT 3.91 m/s^2 (19.6 m/s at crossing); commanded 4 -> GT 6.32 (22.8 m/s). GT ~= commanded + 2 (follower catch-up adds ~2 by the crossing); the variable varies -> sweep runs to completion. The identical est_a 6.342 was a LANDER BUG (reported the run-max |applied|, an early transient) not an estimator failure: at the crossing est 6.34 vs GT 6.32. Decisions: actual_a = GT-measured pre-crossing acceleration, commanded_a separate; est_a = estimate at the launch decision, est_a_max kept as a diagnostic; sixth level commanded 0.5 (GT ~2.5, at the floor) x 5 arms x 10 seeds queued AFTER hln20; paper reports measured levels ~4-8 m/s^2 and states the catch-up offset.
- ACCEL SWEEP VALIDITY FLAG (eval session, a=2 cells landed): est_a = 6.342 at commanded a=2 AND at the smoke's a=4 -> the estimator reads the WaypointFollower catch-up transient (bounded by the vehicle max accel ~6.3) in the ten-frame record; question is whether the CROSSING itself sees the commanded ramp. Ordered: GT-measured acceleration over the 2 s pre-crossing window per landed run; if it tracks the command, the sweep is valid (estimator artifact, columns show it); if ~6.3 at both levels, KILL the sweep now, fix the scenario (spawn farther back so catch-up completes before the ramp window, or start at v0 with velocity set and ramp via target-speed schedule), smoke a=2 and a=6 with GT accel at the crossing matching, relaunch; actual_a becomes GT-measured with commanded_a separate. Second finding: mtr_implied_a ~ -5.7 at actual +2 across arms (mature MTR implies deceleration for an accelerating oncoming): the anticipated learned bias; treatment decided when valid kinematics land. Landers scripts/khonsu_1l_land.py (acc + hln) built.
- ASSOCIATION HARNESS = OFFLINE (eval session building during the central wait; ~1200 trials too many for CARLA): synthetic imported tracks + distractors + pose error at the inputs of the destination's PRODUCTION association function (stable-id merge + position gate), called unchanged; lander column names the function and commit; figure_schemas row 59 and the appendix say "isolated harness on the destination's association function" (same status as the fault table's isolated column).
- 1l WAVE 2 BUILT (eval session; pluggable_base_1l, runner_1l, daemon_1l; 8 overlay files): MIGRATION_MODE replication (REPL_PERIOD_S 0.2), repl_final, kf_final; ONCOMING_SHIFT_X (shift_x_m); HANDOFFROW += prepare_arrival/ready/first_usable_forecast ticks; [CROSSROW] first_detection/tenth_observation/first_prediction/local_observations; [PDSTROW] tick,p_dst,mtr_theta,fired; [FAULTROW]/[FAULTPATH]. Central campaign (accel 2/250 at report time) runs on wave 1 only. DECISIONS: faults block = six daemon injections (lost_prepare, dst_crash, dup_commit, reorder, lost_ack, lost_commit) x epochs off/on x 5 reps + clean control, four outcome columns; association runner BUILT during the central run (half day) and run LAST in the non-central campaign (appendix figure comes out if not landed by the freeze); logging proxies accepted: first_usable_forecast/first_prediction = first planner consumption of a dst forecast (within one 20 Hz planner tick of publication), first_detection/tenth_observation from the dst tracklet local-observation count, definitions to go in figure_schemas.md. Non-central order: freshness, T25b, band+dual, load, theta+p_dst, faults, association.
- DECK v43 PUSHED (pre-check remote == v42): headline slide bullets and notes from LdThirtyOne*/LdTwenty*/Ac*/Mvx* macros (two loaded levels; dense-zone panel shown); figs/make_headline_projected_png.py now reads gen_numbers.tex instead of hardcoded values; paper_*.png re-synced after the RNG-stream regeneration; paper c40a095 (mvx reader on the tracked docs/kb/data/multiv2x copies). Last verified push = verify_v43.pptx.
- PAPER e48624c (fork): Mvx* macros from docs/kb/data/multiv2x/{multiv2x_n_per_zone,multiv2x_n_overall}.csv (56 zones, 16,800 frames at 300/zone; contenders incl. RSU: mean 11.5, p95 21, max 33; 3 dense zones 23.4-27.6) in §5.1 Datasets; loaded blocks framed "near the 95th-percentile count" (20) and "near the dense-zone peaks" (31). Generated loaded files frozengen_hl_n20/n31_rows.csv (7 arms incl. hln<N>_warmnoaccel; machine atlas; ns3_lut_n; migration_accel); cases table two loaded rows; LdTwenty*/LdThirtyOne* macros; abstract/intro loaded sentence on the dense-zone count; rules 254/254. CAVEAT: §5.3 loaded ages (652 / 902 ms) are from the generated load lattice and differ from the 1l smoke medians (250 / 400); they swap when the 1l load file lands. RNG stream moved: every generated CSV/float rewritten (deck paper_*.png re-sync at the next deck build). CENTRAL 1l CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED on Atlas ~16:30 Sep 8 (390 runs): accel sweep 250 runs (~29 h -> Sep 9 ~21:30) -> hln31 70 -> hln20 70 (~13 h -> Sep 10 ~10:30). Accel smoke: est_a 6.3 for true 4 (over-projection ~+2 on 10-frame records, consistent with the cruise noise; columns capture it; mature MTR is the accurate path); kill switch confirmed.
- LOADED LEVELS IN THE PAPER (ordered to the fork): Multi-V2X contender distribution from paper2_figures/multiv2x_n_per_zone.csv (56 zones, 17,525 frames; N_total mean 11.3, p95 21, max 33; dense zones rsu_40 26.6 / rsu_250 22.5 / rsu_41 22.4) as Mvx* macros in §5.1 Datasets; loaded blocks framed as 20 = p95 count, 31 = dense-zone count. Schema row 46 -> frozen1l_hl_n31_rows.csv + frozen1l_hl_n20_rows.csv (STD + ns3_lut_n, machine=atlas, 7 arms incl. warm MIGRATION_ACCEL=0). Projected structure: existing loaded row -> N=31; new generated N=20 row where velocity-carrying arms hold; cases table two loaded rows; Ld20*/Ld31* macros; abstract/intro loaded sentence on the dense-zone count. Accel sweep lands as frozen1l_acc_rows.csv (oncoming_accel, decision_path, est_a, mtr_implied_a, actual_a). Eval session runs a 2-cell accel smoke (ONCOMING_ACCEL=4 term on/off) before the 250-run sweep.
- 1l WAVE-1 SMOKE (eval session): OVERRIDE VALIDATED: realized_age median/p95 live(5) 150/400 = forced N=1 150/400; N=8 150/400; N=12 150/400; N=20 250/600; N=31 400/1100 (max 1400); rise is DL-driven (LUT DL mean/p95 N=16 41/46, N=24 223/301, N=31 402/952). ACCEL ESTIMATOR on real WF records: noise on cruising tracks ~+/-2.2 m/s^2 (GT +/-0.3) -> FLOOR 2.5; early crosser aid 199 (still on its spawn ramp) GT +4.0, est +7.66, term fires; flow outcome unchanged term-on vs term-off (0 collisions; launch 407-472 within ~60-tick GPU non-determinism); kill switch confirmed. DECISIONS (writing session): loaded headline at BOTH N=31 (tail of Multi-V2X, max 33; median age 400 ms, reactive warm-up no longer fits) and N=20 (p95 count; age inside reactive margin), six arms + warm MIGRATION_ACCEL=0 ablation, 10 seeds each, hln31 then hln20 (files named by N); cases table gets two loaded rows. Accel sweep |a| = 2,3,4,5,6 x {warm, warm accel-off, kf, reactive, cold} x10; floor 2.5 stated as the estimator limit. NO cruise respawn to remove the ramp: an actor on its spawn ramp at the crossing is a real accelerating actor; any term-induced outcome change is diagnosed from per-run columns first. Central order on Atlas: accel sweep, hln31, hln20. Freshness lander keeps age at every decision and age at the launch decision (live median 150 vs the paper's 202 at launch).
- APPENDIX FIXED (fork 3366fc4, verified in rendered p26-27 by the writing session): fault table inside the column (scriptsize, 2 pt, p{0.30} fault column, makecell headers, check/dash epoch column, "every run recovered" in the caption); subsections A.1-A.5; [tbp] floats; makecell + amssymb added to pkgs.tex; no overfull box > 10 pt; 27 pages.
- APPENDIX (Tyler: "formatting is terrible"; NSDI allows appendices beyond 12 pages, paper must stand alone, reviewers need not read them): rendered p26 shows the six-column fault table overflowing the column (last column cut off), the association figure overlapping it, caption collisions, [H] stacking. Fork ordered: fault table generator -> scriptsize, 2 pt, p{0.30\columnwidth} fault column, makecell two-line headers (table* fallback); subsections A.1-A.5; [tbp] placement; 0.8\columnwidth figures; rendered-page and overfull-box check.
- 1l WAVE 1 BUILT (eval session; overlay files edge_manager_merged_1l.py, factories_1l.py, tracklet_1l.py, mtr_edge_predictor_1l.py, scenario_1_1l.py; additive, arms byte-identical with knobs unset). OVERRIDE ROOT CAUSE: order-statistic double count: UL age = max(sample_ms(N) for _ in range(N)) with the forced N in BOTH the LUT cell and the loop count; fixed so NS3_LUT_N sets the LUT cell only, max over the live uploader count n_cav, DL single draw. KB correction: in the GT-flow scene the oncoming are GT-injected (not uploaders), live radio n_cav ~1 (ego + RSU); the live ~200 ms is mostly pipeline age; the loaded sweep N=8/12/20/31 raises the LUT cell (deployed radio load). ACCEL DECISIONS (writing session): no per-scenario opt-in (reviewer reads it as tuning); term ON by default for every record-carrying arm in every scenario, gated by the measured floor; env knob MIGRATION_ACCEL=0 only as an ablation kill switch. Estimator switched to (b) position-domain 2nd-order least squares over frames + source ticks (a = 2 c2) because speed-vs-tick gave |a| mean 0.74 / max 1.7 m/s^2 on constant-speed records; floor = p99 |a| on hl_warm + margin, measured and stated in the paper as the estimator limit; sweep magnitudes above the floor plus one level below (term stays off, mature predictor carries it). Sweep arms: warm, warm MIGRATION_ACCEL=0, kf, reactive, cold x10 per level.
- PAPER 08aa0fa (fork): trigger block at 20 seeds (TrLeadLow 18 of 20, TrComputed/Predictor/Gtc 20 of 20, ThetaHalf 20 of 20; appendix table 20/20, 20/20, 19/20, 18/20 for 1-4 s leads; §5.5 reworded; rules read denominators). DECK v42 PUSHED (3df16b3; pre-check remote == v41; notes read the new macros; khonsu_talk_raw.pptx gitignored). Params table: two-locale seeds "10 to 20" (hl/tr at 20, ac/regions at 10). Eval session confirmed the override-fix spec (forced-N = live path with N substituted, same sampler and per-message draw, LUT tail preserved; validation forced N = scene vs live before hln20).
- ATLAS 1k CAMPAIGN COMPLETE: frozen1k_rows.csv 305 rows (hl 120, tr 120, F 40, E theta 25), all valid. 1l BUILD STARTED (overlay on the freeze-1k idfix_wt files; develop diverged). Wave 1 = override fix + accel path; wave 2 = repl_final, kf_final, shift knob, logging incl. _p_dst trace, FAULT_MODE; smoke per wave on Atlas. CONSTRAINT SENT on the override fix: forced-N must be the live path with N overridden (per-message draws from the ns-3 LUT distribution at that N; full tail; no median anchoring); validate forced N = scene N reproduces the live age-at-use distribution (median, p95 within run-to-run spread, 5 seeds) before hln20.
- B 11-20 LANDED (Sep 8 14:43, frozen1k_rows.csv; shape monitor): leads at 20 seeds 1 s 20/20, 2 s 20/20, 3 s 19/20, 4 s 18/20; headline unchanged; no cell regressed vs the prior tag. Fork ordered: regenerate, list changed macros, reword §5.5 around Tr* for 20 seeds, trigger table caption seed count, rules read denominators from rows. Deck trigger slide re-syncs after (remote == v41 check). Atlas is now free for the 1l build.
- CORRIDOR ESTIMATE (eval session, planning only): missing = ~1.2 km route with 4 locales (needs Town04/05, new map + route + spawn geometry), N polygons/boundaries/conflict placement, N-locale handoff CHAINING (flow_gt:495-496 assumes 2 locales; next-hop routing; edge_sets_destination=false today), traffic_n/crossings wiring, the 11-arm co_<arm> runner, per-crossing timeline + crossing-index landers. Reusable = N-parameterized LocaleRouter/registry, pairwise prepare/commit/publish with source/destination ids, burst runner, edge_list config. sizing_rows.csv is generated (schema reference only). Dev: FULL 4-6 days + ~330 runs x 15-20 min = ~99 h -> lands Sep 17-19 (NOT VIABLE); REDUCED (3 locales, 2 crossings/route, cold/reactive/Khonsu/continuous replication, 10 seeds, 1 traffic level) 2.5-3.5 days + ~40 runs = ~10 h on cetus after the 1k tail -> lands Sep 12-14 if the chaining rewrite goes smoothly; risk = the same person builds 1l, so the corridor build threatens the 1l central blocks. Recommendation to Tyler: defer the closed-loop corridor (RQ4 carried by T25 axis + density/burst + capacity + sizing), or REDUCED only with the hard rule that 1l central blocks take precedence. Paper consequences of deferral: §5.7 (route table, timeline, crossing index), §5.6 alternatives scatter (corridor rows), summary right panel, abstract closing sentence and "four-locale corridor", contribution 3 "repeated handoffs" -> alternatives compared on the two-locale scenario + multi-crossing block. AWAITING TYLER.
- SCHEDULE (eval session, Sep 8 14:20; per-run Atlas 3.4 min, cetus flow 5.5, cetus accel 7.5): CETUS 1k sequential: T25 rerun 198 runs -> Sep 9 ~08:30 (regions constant); tail t8 120 -> Sep 9 ~20:00; visible 30 -> ~23:00; netem 36 -> Sep 10 ~02:30. ATLAS -> 1l after B11-20 (done ~15:00 Sep 8), PARALLEL: 1l build+smoke (dev 4-8 h) -> Sep 9 ~12:00; accel magnitude sweep 80 runs -> Sep 9 ~20:00 (regions maneuvering); loaded headline hln20 60 -> Sep 9 ~23:30; theta+p_dst 25 -> Sep 10; freshness ~150 -> Sep 10-11; T25b ~100 -> Sep 11; band+dual ~30 -> Sep 11; load ~75 -> Sep 12; association ~40 -> Sep 12; faults ~30 -> Sep 12-13. CONFIRMED by the writing session (central 1l blocks on Atlas, accel moves off cetus; 5-seed fallback for non-central only if the 1l build slips past Sep 10 and only with confirmation). CORRIDOR: NO RUNNER EXISTS on develop/1k (only the offline sizing analysis); a full corridor is days of build + ~27 h runs; DECISION FOR TYLER (a) build now (risk to Sep 15, competes for Atlas) vs (b) defer the closed-loop corridor and carry RQ4 with density/burst + capacity + sizing; build estimate (full and reduced 3-locale variant) requested from the eval session; nothing starts until Tyler decides.
- T25 RERUN LAUNCHED (cetus, fixed wrapper): smoke confirmed LAUNCHENV ONCOMING_SPEED 8 and 24 applied; GT crossing-to-conflict (x 240->278) v8 4.6-4.8 s, v24 1.6-1.9 s (38 m / speed). 200 runs (5 speeds x 4 arms x 10 seeds) ~30 h; fixed tail queued behind (t8 -> visible -> netem). Invalid logs quarantined under cetus_1k/_invalid_speedbug. Watches: rerun done -> khonsu_t25_land.py -> frozen1k_t25_rows.csv n=10 -> figure_rules regions -> commit. SCHEDULE REQUESTED from the eval session: machine-by-machine table of every remaining block (runs, min/run, hours, land date), load-bearing marks (regions constant, regions maneuvering, loaded headline, corridor), and a reordering/seed-reduction proposal for anything landing after Sep 15 (paper prose freeze; deadline Sep 17).
- WRAPPER AUDIT + E VERDICT (eval session): Atlas frozen_batch_1k_campaign.sh puts defaults BEFORE $* (only EVAL_TAG after; nothing sweeps it) -> headline, trigger/lookahead, F, E all applied their knobs; cetus cetus_1k_batch.sh puts ONCOMING_SPEED/TRIGGER_DIST AFTER "$@" -> only T25 broken (ACC, tail knobs live in "$@"); env order fixed in the seeds and tail scripts too. E (theta) NOT clobbered: LAUNCHENV shows MTR_THETA 0.3..0.9 per run; flow_gt:586 consumes it; prepare_tick 54 (0.3) then 59 flat for theta >= 0.4. Reason from the code: the mtr branch fires only when _p_dst >= theta AND a theta-independent lead gate holds (predicted time-to-crossing < L = transfer EMA + fold-in + margin, flow_gt ~596); the lead gate binds first on this geometry. _p_dst is not logged at runtime (saturation inferred). Decision: add a one-line _p_dst log to the 1l logging fields and rerun the 5 theta cells x5 on 1l (theta table lands on 1l with the trace); the paper's theta sentence states the lead-gate reason from the code path meanwhile.
- T25 DEFECT (eval session, caught by the lander): every cetus T25 run executed at ONCOMING_SPEED=12 regardless of the v8..v24 label. Root cause: batch run() = `env "$@" ONCOMING_SPEED=12 TRIGGER_DIST=300 python ...`; the hardcoded default AFTER "$@" wins (env FOO=8 FOO=12 -> 12). scenario_1.py honors ONCOMING_SPEED. The v12 slice was coincidentally valid (flow@12 gate passed for real). Seeds 1-5 and the queued 6-10 are INVALID for the sweep; quarantined, not deleted. Tail (FLOW_N, arms, burst/visible/netem) unaffected (those knobs live in "$@"). Plan approved (fix-and-rerun whole): kill batch + seeds, fix env order (defaults BEFORE "$@") in the T25 script and the tail, smoke v8 + v24 showing different crossing-to-conflict times, rerun the whole T25 at n=10 (200 runs), tail behind it. Ordered: audit every 1k run() wrapper (Atlas + cetus) for post-"$@" defaults; VERIFY THE THETA SWEEP (E, "inert") from the logged theta per run: if clobbered, E is invalid, Theta macros/sentence come out of the paper and E reruns whole; if it varied, the inert result stands with the reason from logged probabilities. Headline/record/trigger blocks ran at 12 m/s by design (unaffected by the speed clobber).
- CETUS TAIL BUILT (cetus_1k_tail.sh, pid 720588 waiting on cetus_1k.lock behind seeds 6-10): (1) burst_{warm,edgewarp,cold}_r1..10 (openscenario_1_burst_gt) + q5_n{2,4,8}_{warm,edgewarp,cold}_r1..10 (flow_gt FLOW_N) -> frozen1k_cetus_t8_rows.csv (1j column set; tags q5_/burst_ kept because make_floats.py and khonsu_multicross_diag.py read them; dens_ was never adopted); (2) viscon_{6 arms}_s1..5 -> frozen1k_cetus_53_rows.csv; (3) netem_l{0,3,20,50}_j_p{0,0.1,1}{_meas|_stress}_s1..3 warm grpc -> frozen1k_cetus_netem_rows.csv. Paper-side TODO when t8 lands: density + burst tables move from make_floats.py into plot_figures.py reading frozen1k_cetus_t8_rows.csv.
- CETUS QUEUE (after T25 v24): seeds 6-10 for T25 (cetus_t25_seeds_6_10.sh on cetus_1k.lock; 100 runs; _t25_seeds6_10_done) -> cetus_1k_tail.sh (to be built from cetus_1j_tail.sh with the 1k env: torch.load shim, weights_only sed, LFS restore, no re-checkout) in the order: (1) multi-crossing block at 10 seeds (density 2/4/8 + five-vehicle burst, every 1g/1j arm, scale-table contract, dens_*/burst_* rows; khonsu_multicross_diag.py runs on it; selector decision gated on its verdict), (2) visible matrix unchanged from 1j -> frozen1k_cetus_53_rows.csv, (3) netem unchanged -> frozen1k_cetus_netem_rows.csv. The loaded headline hln20 does NOT run on 1k (override defect); it runs on 1l on cetus after the 1l smoke at 10 seeds -> frozen1l_cetus_hl_n20_rows.csv. Nothing else touches cetus.
- T25 LANDING PLAN: cetus flow@12 gate pre-validated from the v12 slice (warm/reactive/kf 5/5 clean, cold 0/5); lander built to figure_schemas row 5 (frozen1k_t25_rows.csv, STD + seed/contact_actor/crossing_tick/do_ov_tick(sustained)/conflict_tick/t_avail_s/time_to_observe_s/frames_at_commit/motion=constant, machine=cetus column; t_avail_s = (conflict_tick - crossing_tick) x 0.05 with crossing = oncoming enters x>=240, conflict = x>=278). Regions rule requires n>=10 per (arm, speed); cetus ran 5 seeds. DECISION (writing session): extend seeds 6-10 on cetus after v24 (same tag/scenario/lander), land the block ONCE at n=10; the 5-seed partial is not landed; the caption's "twenty runs per point" is generated text replaced by the count macro. Maneuvering rows arrive from the 1l acceleration sweep into the same file (motion=maneuvering).
- DECK v41 PUSHED (scale_out_nsdi 19d76af): pre-check remote == verify_v40 passed; two-locale constant slide bullet + notes carry the measured cold mechanism (Diag macros: 3.7 vs 11.8 m/s, 11.7 m short at 1.25 s, 6 head-ons + 3 rear-ends, reactive 2 rear-ends); figs/real_headline_1k.png regenerated at 20 seeds from frozen1k_rows.csv (the repo copy had been the 10-seed 00:54 file; v40 had used the old scratchpad copy); paper_*.png re-synced from the redrawn floats; builder R() now resolves slides/figs first (the repo builder had pointed at slides/ where the assets are not). Pipeline of record: python3 slides/build_khonsu_talk.py -> soffice --headless --convert-to pptx -> python3 transplant_comments.py <previous khonsu_story.pptx as comment source> <resaved> <out> -> cp to slides/khonsu_story.pptx -> ~/bin/rclone copyto ... gtvault:khonsu_story.pptx -> download and cmp. Last verified push = verify_v41.pptx (this session scratchpad and the old story dir). rclone lives at ~/bin/rclone (not on PATH in tool shells).
- PAPER f8dbf18 (fork): §5.1 mechanism now measured over all six cold head-ons ("rebuilt track has five to seven frames at the launch and carries a median speed of 3.7 m/s against the actor's 11.8 m/s, so its 1.25 s forecast places the vehicle a median 11.7 m short ... The migrated record carries the source's velocity estimate, so no arm that receives it under-speeds the oncoming vehicle"); §2.3 coverage-gap sentences added with forward ref; "blind" remains only as the scenario name; "no usable forecast" gone. Macros DiagColdOwnSpeedMed 3.7 / DiagColdActualSpeedMed 11.8 / DiagColdOwnFdeOnePtwofiveMed 11.7 / DiagColdOwnFirstForecastBeforeLaunch 6 of 6 / DiagGatingCommit* 255. Rules 240/240 (own forecast before launch; own speed < half actual; commit tick identical across depths). Fig 15 and Fig 16 legends moved below; black-and-white pass over every float (marker shape + line style; grayscale render checked). 27 pages.
- HEADLINE NUMBERS FINAL (eval session 0cc7cc6f; both diag files, new cols own_fde1p25_at_launch, own_speed_at_launch, actual_speed_at_launch; horizon 1.25 s because the model emits 0.25/0.5/1.25/3/5 s and all six head-ons have GT at launch+1.25 s): own_speed 3.78/2.04/4.10/3.60/4.10/3.60 m/s (median 3.69) vs actual 11.5-12.2; own_fde1p25 11.73/11.73/11.73/11.23/11.14/11.81 m (median 11.73). Rear-ends: r1 own_speed 27.6 outlier (just-acquired track, not in the claim); r12/r13 launch after 201 cleared (cols empty). Fork ordered: §5.1 rewrite on own speed + 1.25 s error (all six), §2.3 coverage-gap sentences, "blind" audit (scenario name kept), Diag macros + rules (own first forecast before launch 6/6; own speed < half actual; gating commit identical across depths), Fig 15 legend below, Fig 16 crowding, black-and-white readability pass with grayscale render check.
- PAPER 9ffaf1e (fork): all Tyler Overleaf comments addressed, each \tl marker kept with \tl{Fixed: ...}; abstract closes on three result sentences (maneuvering, loaded, corridor; compliance % and replication bytes commented out); intro Kalman/MambaTrack paragraph rewritten in plain language; cooperative prediction and maneuver defined at first use; rebuild restated as the predictor's ten frames; contribution 3 split; conductor2026 bib note "To appear at ACM/IEEE SEC 2026; arXiv:2609.04364"; "cooperative-prediction" -> "cooperative prediction" (15 places; 3 deck builder strings left for the writing session); canvas figure moved to floats/float-canvas.tex (Conductor convention; 17 inline figure envs remain, Tyler to decide); memory sentence commented out; tables cases/fde/corridor/overlap-breakdown fit the column (markers moved out of generated files); figures regions/freshness/trigger/alternatives/overlap/route/crossings/summary redrawn with legends below, no point labels, larger fonts. 26 pages, rules 238/238. Rendered-page check (writing session): all fit; residual = Fig 15 capacity legend inside the top panel overlaps curves; Fig 16 sizing legend/colorbar crowding; queued with the B&W-readability pass and the §5.1 under-speed rewrite after the speed columns land. Intro spans p1 col 2 to p3 (< 3 pages, prescreen OK).
- NSDI 27 CFP CHECKLIST (Tyler pasted the CFP 2026-09-08): 12 pages max incl. figures/tables (refs + appendix extra; paper must stand alone) -> draft is 25 pp, trim after data lands per Tyler; two-column 10pt Times, 7x9 in block, page numbers required; double-blind (third-person self-citation OK: Conductor cited third person; no own links; care with file names; strip \ad/\tl/\KR markers at submission); TRACK must be indicated on the title page and in the form (Traditional Research Track); PRESCREENING reads only the Introduction (<= 3 pages) for scope, understandability by a non-subfield PC member, and clear intellectual contributions + evaluative claims with some evidence; figures legible without magnification and readable in black and white (add to the figure pass: marker shapes/line styles, not color alone); one-shot revision possible; author limit 8 submissions. Deadlines: abstract Sep 10, paper Sep 17.
- HEADLINE MECHANISM FINAL (eval session 050161e5; columns gating_commit_tick, own_first_forecast_tick, own_fde3_at_launch in both diag files; gating_commit_tick = 255 across depths): COLD IS NOT BLIND. In all 6 cold head-ons the destination produces its OWN forecast of 201 at tick 258-259, before the launch at 280-285 (5-7 edge frames). The rebuilt track is cold-started with velocity near zero, so the +3 s forecast places 201 ~18 m short of truth: own_fde3_at_launch 17.27 / 17.76 / 25.59 m (median 17.8; blank on r8/r16/r20 where contact is under 3 s away). Correct sentence: "cold launches on a five-to-seven-frame destination forecast that misses the oncoming's approach by a median of 17.8 m." The blind column means "no MIGRATED forecast" (blank first_use -> blind=1 for cold) and must NOT be used for the cold claim; use own_fde3. Cold truck rear-ends (r1, r12, r13) = held and crept into the stopped truck (do_ov False through a long hold, 0-2.6 m/s creep in own lane, contact at ego x~282-283, ticks 474-502), same failure mode as reactive r14. Separating mechanism: the migrated record carries the source-side velocity estimate, so warm/reactive/kf never under-speed the oncoming. Paper §5.1 "launches blind" sentence and the "cold head-ons all blind" rule to be replaced (queued for the fork after the Overleaf-comment batch); §2.3 gets the coverage-gap line (destination sees the actor only at the crossing and its rebuilt track starts with velocity near zero).
- OVERLEAF 2026-09-08 16:44 (Tyler merged into main himself, 9186649): the earlier overleaf-2026-09-08-1532 branch had NO Overleaf edits (stale midday-Sep-7 snapshot on an older base; the pptx absent on the Overleaf side -> modify/delete conflict, main kept). The 1644 branch carries Tyler's \tl{} comments + word edits: abstract (headline results at the end, too many numbers), intro (Conductor to-appear/arXiv, define cooperative prediction, not a compound word, Kalman/SSM paragraph in wrong place and jargon, define maneuver, "two seconds" is configurable, contribution 3 dense), motivation (drop memory stipulation; canvas figure to a float.tex per the Conductor convention), figure readability (regions legend over data; envelope curves unreadable; trigger and alternatives labels overlap and no legend, alternatives runs into the next column; overlap legend entry too long; route hard to read; crossings off page; summary too busy), gen_tab_cases off the page (marker inside a generated file -> moved to the wrapper). Fork ordered to address all with \tl{Fixed: ...} appended after each marker; Conductor stays third-person cited (double-blind) with the arXiv id in the bib note. Tyler asked whether the measured data matches the generated graphs and the story: answered in chat (matches: headline flow, trigger table, record forecast error; does not match: acceleration (scenario defect, 1l); pending: regions T25, loaded, freshness, overlap, corridor, capacity, faults, netem, association, sizing).
- COLD MECHANISM RESOLVED (eval session, 6 head-on cold runs r3/r7/r8/r16/r17/r20, systematic): source edge tracks 201 from tick 132 (never delivered in cold); DESTINATION first tracks 201 only when it crosses into locale_0 (x>=240) at tick 258-259; sustained launch 280-285 -> 22-27 sim ticks = 5-7 edge frames (edge_dt 0.2) at the decision, right at the predictor's 5-frame minimum; 201 at x~252 approaching the x=278 conflict at launch. Warm: 201 usable at ~267 with the full record, ego holds behind the truck until 201 passes, launches ~390. CAUSE = cold-start coverage gap (destination sensing does not span the source locale); PROXIMATE = rebuild window (5-7 frames vs full migrated record). Pending datum for the headline wording: cold's own first published forecast tick for 201 vs launch (launch before first forecast -> "launches before the rebuilt track has produced a forecast"; forecast exists -> "launches on a five-to-seven-frame forecast that misses by X m"); columns own_first_forecast_tick, own_fde3_at_launch ordered; same for the 3 cold truck rear-ends. Paper 70a4d1b (writing session): "record and not the trigger sets this outcome" softened to "the trigger does not separate the snapshot records at this speed" (EdgeWarp snapshot 10/10, Kalman state 20/20).
- COLD HEAD-ON WORDING RESOLVED (2026-09-08, own-forecast cols landed 050161e5): the destination DOES publish its own forecast of 201 BEFORE launch in all 6 head-on runs (own_first_forecast_tick 258-259 vs launch 280-285), so this is the REBUILD-WINDOW mechanism, NOT blind/no-forecast. The forecast is UNDER-SPEED: cold re-acquires 201 at x=240 with velocity cold-started near zero, so its +3 s forecast lands ~18 m short (own_fde3_at_launch 17.27/17.76/25.59, median 17.8 m; blank on r8/r16/r20 where contact is <3 s). PAPER WORDING = "cold launches on a five-to-seven-frame destination forecast that misses the oncoming's approach by a median of 17.8 m." CAUTION: blind=1 on these rows but blind is defined on migration first_use (cold never migrates) so it means "no MIGRATED forecast", not "no forecast" -> use own_fde3, not blind, for the cold head-on claim. 3 cold truck rear-ends (r1/r12/r13, partner 198) held+crept into the stopped truck like reactive (do_ov False through a long hold, ego 302->286 at 0-2.6 m/s in own lane, contact 474-502). Migration arms lack the under-speed problem because the migrated record carries the source velocity estimate; that is the mechanism separating them from cold. Resolves the pending datum in the prior COLD MECHANISM bullet and the FINAL DIAGNOSTICS open question (rebuild-window with a frame count at launch, not a pure coverage gap).
- COLD HEAD-ON UNDER-SPEED QUANTIFIED FOR ALL SIX (2026-09-08, own_speed cols landed 0cc7cc6f): direct velocity evidence now covers all six head-ons, not just the three with +3 s GT. own_speed_at_launch (destination's estimated |v| of its own 201 track at launch, = |pred(+0.25s)-Actual_now|/0.25) = 3.78/2.04/4.10/3.60/4.10/3.60 for r3/r7/r8/r16/r17/r20, median 3.69 m/s, against actual_speed_at_launch ~11.5-12.2 (median ~12). own_fde1p25_at_launch (1.25 s = largest EMITTED forecast horizon <=1.5 s; the model outputs only 0.25/0.5/1.25/3.0/5.0, so 1.5 s does not exist as a point) = 11.14-11.81, median 11.73 m, present for all six. PAPER: prefer own_speed_at_launch (root cause, all six) as the number - "rebuilt track carries a median 3.7 m/s against the actor's ~12 m/s, its 1.25 s forecast a median 11.7 m short"; own_fde3 (~18 m, 3 runs) is the deeper-horizon corroboration. Truck rear-ends: r1 populated but own_speed 27.6 = just-acquired jumpy track (outlier, excluded); r12/r13 empty (launch 465/495 after 201 cleared). Diag cols: ablation 34 / headline 36.
- T25 SPEED-SWEEP DEFECT + FIX (2026-09-08): the cetus T25 sweep ran EVERY speed at 12 m/s. Root cause: cetus run() did `env "$@" ONCOMING_SPEED=12 TRIGGER_DIST=300 ...` with the defaults AFTER "$@", so env last-wins clobbered the per-run ONCOMING_SPEED=$spd (scenario_1.py:63 honors ONCOMING_SPEED; proven env FOO=8 FOO=12 -> 12). WRAPPER AUDIT (peer-requested): Atlas frozen_batch_1k_campaign.sh:59 uses `eval "ONCOMING_SPEED=12 TRIGGER_DIST=300 $* ..."` (defaults BEFORE $* -> safe -> ALL Atlas blocks clean: headline, trigger/lookahead, F, E). ONLY cetus T25 broke (ACC passes ONCOMING_ACCEL in "$@", tail sweeps FLOW_N/arms/TRANSFER_MODE in "$@" -> none clobbered). FIX: defaults BEFORE "$@" (cetus_t25_rerun.sh + cetus_1k_tail.sh). SMOKE verified: v8 t_avail 4.7 s, v24 1.6 s (was flat 3.1 s). Invalid logs quarantined cetus_1k/_invalid_speedbug (96). RE-RUN launched: 5 speeds x 4 arms x 10 seeds = 200 (fixed) -> tail behind it. Land frozen1k_t25_rows.csv at n=10 via scripts/khonsu_t25_land.py (figure_schemas row 5 cols: STD + seed,contact_actor,crossing_tick,do_ov_tick,conflict_tick,t_avail_s,time_to_observe_s,frames_at_commit,motion=constant; machine=cetus is the host col; oncoming_speed parsed from tag v{spd}). E THETA AUDIT: NOT clobbered (Atlas eval safe; MTR_THETA varied 0.3-0.9 in LAUNCHENV + consumed flow_gt:586 `if _p_dst<MTR_THETA`); prepare_tick flat (54 at 0.3, 59 at 0.4-0.9) = theta-INDEPENDENT LEAD GATE binds (predicted TTC<L=xfer EMA+fold-in+margin, flow_gt ~596). Inert result STANDS, NO E rerun on 1k; the one-line _p_dst-per-decision log is deferred to the 1l theta rerun (5 theta x5) so the paper states the lead-gate reason from the trace not inference. Watches: bs3840z0x (T25 rerun done -> land n=10), beuvhlyd5 (Atlas B11-20 -> 1l).
- ATLAS 1k COMPLETE + FREEZE-1l BUILT/LAUNCHED (2026-09-08): Atlas freeze-1k campaign done (_campaign_done 14:38; frozen1k_rows.csv 305 rows = hl 120 / tr 120 / F 40 / E_theta 25, all valid, committed). freeze-1l built as an OVERLAY on the 1k overlay (develop code diverged, so 1l bases on freeze-1k = the idfix_wt 10-file overlay). WAVE-1 files (scratchpad *_1l.py): edge_manager_merged_1l, factories_1l, tracklet_1l, mtr_edge_predictor_1l, scenario_1_1l. OVERRIDE FIX (order-statistic double-count: 1k forced NS3_LUT_N into BOTH the LUT cell AND max(range(N)); fix = N -> LUT cell index only, max over live n_cav, DL single draw, tail preserved). SMOKE-VALIDATED: realized_age median/p95 live 150/400, forced N=1 150/400 (identical, live n_cav~1 since flow oncoming are GT obstacles not radio uploaders), N=8/12 150/400, N=20 250/600, N=31 400/1100 (max 1400), tail preserved. ACCEL PATH: position-domain 2nd-order polyfit (a=2*c2) over record positions+source ticks; DEFAULT ON (MIGRATION_ACCEL=0 = ablation kill switch only, per peer - no per-scenario opt-in); floor 2.5 (cruise noise ~+/-2.2 on real WF 10-frame records; est OVER-projects, est_a=6.3 for true a=4). kf stays CV. Accel smoke: constant-accel-from-spawn works, estimator captures+applies, kill switch = 0 CAMIGRATED. CENTRAL CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED on Atlas (390 runs, overlay verified intact, watch b83l48l9x on _acc_done): accel sweep |a|=2/3/4/5/6 x {warm, warm-abl, kf, reactive, cold} x10 (250) -> frozen1l_acc_rows.csv (+oncoming_accel/decision_path/est_a/mtr_implied_a/actual_a); hln31 then hln20 (7 arms x10 each, NS3_LUT_N=31/20) -> frozen1l_hl_n31/n20_rows.csv (STD+ns3_lut_n, machine=atlas). N=31=tail load (400ms, stresses reactive), N=20=p95 load (250ms). WAVE-2 building (subagent afc730): repl_final/replication, kf_final, ONCOMING_SHIFT_X/shift_x_m, logging (prepare_arrival/ready/first_usable_forecast, per-crossing first_detection/tenth_observation/first_prediction, assoc separation, _p_dst-per-decision), FAULT_MODE. cetus env-order fix in cetus_t25_rerun/tail. Freshness lander keeps BOTH age measures (every-decision ~150 median, launch-decision ~202). Corridor: NO runner exists -> planning sent to Tyler (FULL not viable, REDUCED ~2.5-3.5d+10h; recommend defer). Schedule: 3/4 central land ~Sep 9-10; corridor is the 4th (Tyler's call).
- 1l WAVE-2 DONE + ACCEL VALIDITY + ASSOCIATION (2026-09-08): wave-2 built (pluggable_base_1l, runner_1l, daemon_1l): replication/repl_final (cadence re-send + final sync), kf_final, ONCOMING_SHIFT_X, HANDOFFROW+CROSSROW+PDSTROW logging, FAULT_MODE (6 daemon injections x{off,on}x5+control -> 4 outcome cols). Central landers built: scripts/khonsu_1l_land.py (acc+hln). ACCEL SWEEP VALIDITY (peer-gated, checked on landed cells): GT accel at crossing (2nd-order fit on GT positions, no estimator) VARIES with commanded (a2->3.91, a4->6.32 m/s^2, speed 19.6/22.8) = sweep valid, runs to completion; offset ~+2 above commanded (follower catch-up). est_a=6.342-identical was a LANDER BUG (reported greatest-magnitude transient not the at-crossing value; at a4 the at-crossing est 6.34 ~= GT 6.32, accurate). Lander fix in flight: actual_a = GT-measured accel (not commanded), commanded_a separate col, est_a = value at launch decision (CAMIGRATED has no tick -> interleave with timestamped EGO-DBG ticks), est_a_max = run-max diagnostic. Added a=0.5 6th level (GT ~2.5 at floor) queued after hln20 (atlas_1l_acc05.sh, blocking flock behind central). mtr_implied_a ~-5.7 while actual +2 = MTR learned bias (kept, decide at land). ASSOCIATION appendix (scripts/khonsu_assoc_trial.py, frozen1l_assoc_rows.csv, 1200 rows, REAL fn data_association/compute_affinity commit 24f83c9f): stable_id 1.00 all cells, geometry degrades 1.0->0.05 with pose_err. TWO CODE FINDINGS (peer deciding framing before commit): (1) STABLE-ID IS DORMANT in the live loop - process_dets sets det.carla_id not det.info, so compute_affinity's det_cid is always -1 and live association is PURE GEOMETRY; the stable-id merge exists but is unreachable (harness attaches .info to exercise it). Weakens any closed-loop "carried identity gives robust association" claim; fix = propagate .info in process_dets (large+late) OR frame the figure as the function's capability (row 59 isolated harness) + state live loop uses geometry. (2) mismatched-identity forbid is INVERTED (COST_MAX=+1e3 but data_association maximizes -> conflicting-id distractor steals the bind); harness uses anonymous clutter so figure unaffected. NOT committed pending peer framing.
- PAPER 49e2a7c (fork): §5.2 tail now "The record acts on forecast quality and not on when the oncoming vehicle becomes usable ... first used at the destination at a mean tick of 270.0, 270.8, 273.0 for one, two, five frames, a spread that follows the seed ... Closed-loop success at this speed differs by one run in ten, and that run ended in a rear-end into the stopped truck. The closed-loop separation the paper relies on is cold start against the migrating arms in Table 5 and the maneuvering panel." §5.1: "Its 9 collisions are 6 head-ons with the oncoming vehicle and 3 rear-ends into the stopped truck. Reactive history collides 2 times, each a rear-end into the truck from a late launch. No arm that delivers the oncoming vehicle's forecast before the launch collides with it." Predicted-collision clause and contact-speed sentence dropped (no columns; return when landed). record_diag reads both files; macros DiagCollided/HeadOn/RearEnd/CollisionPartner/Blind/GatingFirstUse*/Launch* (sustained: one-frame median 418, earliest 390). Rules 238/238: gating first use spread 3.0 ticks; migrating arms zero head-ons with 201; all 6 cold head-ons blind (all 20 cold runs launch blind). Commit-tick sentence NOT in the paper: files lack the destination commit column -> gating_commit_tick ordered from the eval session (rule skips until it lands). Audit: no remaining depth->closed-loop claim; borderline "record and not the trigger sets this outcome" (both cells 10/10) being softened by the writing session.
- FINAL DIAGNOSTICS LANDED 14e34b6e (eval session): frozen1k_ablation_diag.csv + frozen1k_headline_diag.csv with ONE sustained launch definition (first run of >=4 consecutive do_ov=True), blind column, collision_partner_resolved (nearest non-ego actor at collision onset). 36 rows changed vs first-do_ov (cold 14, reactive 7, edgewarp 5, handover 3, warm 1, kf 1, fa_one_frame 3, fa_hist5 2); fa_one_frame_r1 270->430 (transient); reactive_r14 285->470. Shared first decision (arrive/hold at truck) ~190-200 in every arm; overtake launch medians span 237-402. DEPTH->FIRST-USE HYPOTHESIS REFUTED: gating oncoming 201 committed at the destination at tick 255 in ALL 10 seeds for one_frame and hist5 alike; first_use lags 12-22 ticks by SEED (means 272.0 vs 273.6). hist5 r1: informed hold behind truck 267-390 (own lane, creep 0.3-2.5 m/s), 201 crosses conflict at 321, launch ~390 after it passes. PARTNERS: cold 9 = 6 head-ons with 201 + 3 rear-ends into truck 198; reactive 2 = both truck rear-ends (too-late overtake creeping into the stopped truck); warm/kf/edgewarp/handover 0. MECHANISM OF RECORD: migration eliminates the oncoming collisions; only cold (never delivers 201, globally detectable at 132) launches blind into it; residual collisions under migration are longitudinal rear-ends. Record-depth ablation = forecast-quality result only (does not drive closed-loop at flow@12). Fork ordered: §5.2 rewrite (forecast quality; commit tick depth-independent; one-run margin with partner from data), §5.1 partner sentences from macros, rules replaced (commit tick identical across depths; migrating arms zero head-ons; cold head-ons all blind), audit. Eval session asked: does the destination ever track 201 on its own in cold before launch/contact (never = sensing-coverage gap at scale, new §5.1 sentence + §2.3 line; yes = rebuild-window mechanism with frame count at launch).
- PAPER (writing session, after b603083): §5.2 mechanism sentences replaced with the verified-safe blind-launch statement (shallow record delays the gating oncoming's first usable forecast at the destination; one-frame launch precedes it in the runs examined; the one collision is such a launch; five frames usable before launch, planner holds until the gap is real). The b603083 "record does not set the forecast the decision consumes" sentences and the first-do_ov launch statistics are removed; DiagLaunch* macros stay defined but unused until the sustained-do_ov re-land (PENDING comment in the tex).
- CORRECTION (eval session): "CID 201 = truck" in the prior summary was WRONG. Verified from GT-inject + collision partners: 201 is a MOVING oncoming car (x 156->339 at 12 m/s) and the collision partner in the cold head-ons; the stationary firetruck (overtake subject, x=278) is a different non-GT-injected actor. The gating oncoming at launch is 201 (first_use ~267-277), not 200, so the "launch-timing only, Case 2" reading is superseded. Corrected F mechanism: one_frame r1 launch 270 < 201 first_use 273 -> BLIND (marginal); hist5 r1 launch 390 >> first_use 267 -> INFORMED. Shallow arms launch early and blind, deep arms late and informed: the SAME blind-launch mechanism as the headline. Headline diag (frozen1k_headline_diag.csv, n=20/arm): warm/kf/edgewarp/handover 0 collided, 201 usable before launch; reactive 2/20 (r4 launch 270 < first_use 271 blind; r14 launch 285 > 271, cause TBD); cold 9/20: 201 never delivered, ego launches on occluded local perception -> BLIND CONFIRMED, partner 201 head-on where resolved. Caveats: 6/9 cold collisions have launch_tick=105 = early do_ov transient (clears; operative overtake ~285-300); collision_partner column currently emits the ego id (197). Orders sent: ONE sustained-do_ov launch definition for all arms and both files (rows changed per arm reported); per-seed blind table with true partner via track_id/obs_pos; causal reading from data (is the first hold/launch instant arm-independent? why is first_use later with one frame than five, systematic?; hist5 planner state 267-390); reactive r14 cause. §5.2 paragraph (b603083 text) is HELD and will be rewritten once from the final rows; headline "launches blind" stands; the "strikes the truck in some runs" sentence changes if every resolved cold collision is a head-on with 201.
- PAPER b603083 (fork): §5.2 record-ablation paragraph rewritten on the launch-timing path with DiagLaunch{Med,Iqr,Min,Collided}* macros computed from per-run rows of frozen1k_ablation_diag.csv (one_frame median 400, earliest 270, IQR 326-411, collision at 280; hist5 median 398, IQR 390-408); "without the recheck" sentence dropped; rule replaced by "every collided run launched before its depth median". Audit of decision-consumes-migrated-forecast claims: MEASURED and under the headline timing check = evaluation.tex:405-407 ("Cold start gives it no usable forecast ... launches blind") and :387-389 ("history transfer at the crossing arrives within its warm-up"); everything else is projected (regions 319-324, 348-351; intro 74-80 counts; abstract 14-22, 32-34 loaded counts) or design argument (312-316, 141-143 metric def, intro 101-110, motivation 96, design 118-119). The 100-220 tick gating lead is stated from the eval session figure with a source comment until gating_track_id/gating_first_use_tick land.
- RECORD-ABLATION MECHANISM RESOLVED = LAUNCH TIMING (eval session, 1k flow@12, all 10 reps): the gating oncoming (CARLA 200) is imported 100-220 ticks before launch (one_frame first_use 167, launch 270; hist5 launch 390); tracker window 10 frames ~40 ticks, so migrated frames are gone by the decision; the decision forecast is live. Diag FDE (69.0/61.8/40.7 m at 3 s) = early post-import forecast quality (run average while migrated frames are in the window), NOT error at the decision. Path: shallow record -> worse early forecasts -> earlier, noisier overtake commits (one_frame 270/280/305 then ~400; its one collision r4 launched at 280) vs hist5 later and tighter (390-425, two early 280/310, none collided). Closed-loop margin at 12 m/s is one run in ten; load-bearing closed-loop separation goes to the maneuvering panel. Paper §5.2 rewrite ordered (fork): depth -> early forecast error primary; timing path with launch macros from per-run rows; drop "without the recheck". Eval session ordered: launch_tick/collided/gating_track_id/gating_first_use_tick columns in frozen1k_ablation_diag.csv; SAME TIMING CHECK ON THE HEADLINE ARMS (frozen1k_headline_diag.csv): for collided cold runs, launch before vs after the destination's first usable forecast (blind launch = paper mechanism; after = mechanism sentence changes); late first detection from boundary sensing coverage reported separately. Fork audit ordered: every sentence tying the migrated forecast to the flow decision.
- DECISION-PATH TIMING (eval session, r1): FLOW launch tick warm 390 / kf 435 / reactive 410 / edgewarp 280 vs first_use 67-75 and commit 55, no CVMIGRATED/CVSWITCH: the flow decision consumes the mature MTR forecast; no immature window in flow. ACC (ego-step): launch 130 for every arm, commit 131, first_use 153: the ego launches BEFORE the migrated oncoming is first used, on local perception alone; then the 5->16 step fires (152-196). Ego-step ACC is invalid as a maneuvering test on two counts (migration after the decision; exogenous step); its 0/10 is the exogenous-step limit only. Sweep v0/cap acceptance: first_use < launch and still accelerating at launch and crossing, reported per level. OPEN QUESTION to the eval session: in flow, which track gates the launch at ~390 and what is its first-use tick (fresh import vs imported hundreds of ticks earlier)? If the latter, the depth-dependent FDE at the decision needs a named path (launch-timing shift, association break, seed pairing) before §5.2 claims "success follows forecast error".
- 1l ACCELERATION PATH ORDERED (writing session, after eval-session flag that the migrated record carries only a CV estimate: exported vel = last-3-frame velocity; pre-commit coast = anchor + v dt; immature-import forecast = CV; only the mature MTR forecast can represent acceleration): the destination estimates acceleration from the transferred frames + source ticks (least-squares speed vs tick over the record; no record change, no byte change) and uses constant-acceleration extrapolation in the coast and the immature-import forecast, gated on |a| above a noise floor set from the estimator spread on the 1k hl_warm constant-speed records (p99 + margin); [CAMIGRATED] logged with estimated a, and MTR-implied a from the first mature forecast. Kalman arm stays CV by definition. Pre-build report ordered: launch-decision tick vs commit tick vs first mature MTR forecast per arm (flow and ACC, one seed each) to say which path the ego consumes today. Sweep lands once with per-run columns: decision path (coast/immature/mature), estimated a, MTR-implied a, actual a. Paper §4 "Early preparation" paragraph (coast uses last transferred velocity) updates when the block lands.
- ACC DIAGNOSIS (eval session, cetus ac_warm_r1): ONCOMING_ACCEL is a boolean in scenario_1.py; when on, the oncoming cruises at 5.0 m/s and steps to 16.0 m/s the moment the EGO comes within 30 m of the conflict (x=278). The step is ego-triggered and exogenous: at the launch decision (tick 130) the oncoming is at ~5 m/s and the forecast is right for the observed state; the step fires after launch (8.6 at 152, 15.5 at 174, 16.0 at 196), min TTC 0.19. No history-based arm can predict it, so every arm is 0/10 and nothing differentiates. Tyler: "We need khonsu to work with acceleration." Steer: (a) 1l scenario change: ONCOMING_ACCEL becomes a float m/s^2 constant acceleration from spawn (trend in the record); old step kept as ONCOMING_STEP=1 (exogenous-step limit, KB only for now); sweep 4 magnitudes x {warm,kf,reactive,cold} x5 on cetus -> frozen1l_cetus_acc_rows.csv with oncoming_accel + forecast-implied vs actual accel at decision. If warm fails where its forecast-implied acceleration is well below actual, that is a Khonsu defect (add an acceleration term to the migrated record, CA coast + CA immature-import forecast) and the block reruns whole on the tag that carries it.
- CETUS VALIDATED (T25 warm/reactive/kf at 12 m/s 5/5 each, cold 0/5, matching Atlas hl_warm 20/20): the ACC wipeout is REAL acceleration hardness at the current ONCOMING_ACCEL (warm, kf, edgewarp_full, reactive, cold 0/10; handover 1/10). Decision: ACC lands as measured at its level but is NOT the maneuvering panel (no differentiation); acceleration magnitude becomes an axis: (1) extractor-1 diagnosis on the ACC logs per arm (forecast error and implied acceleration at the launch decision, gap, TTC, contact actor: is the full-record forecast itself wrong, or right and the planner launches anyway?); (2) report the ONCOMING_ACCEL value and how it enters; (3) acceleration-magnitude sweep on cetus after T25 (about four levels from mild to current; warm, kf, reactive, cold x5; frozen1k_cetus_acc_rows.csv with oncoming_accel). The panel is drawn at the differentiating level with the full severity curve alongside; the wipeout level is the limit of every current arm; if the full-record forecast is wrong at the decision, the acceleration-aware estimator is the stated follow-up. Paper maneuvering panel stays generated until then.
- For the Sep 7 11:00 talk: the 1g/1f/1g-density figures in the deck stand (code-only lineage, consistent set). Nothing from 1i or 1j lands in the deck before the talk unless a 1j block completes and passes the shape check.

## 2026-09-06 (writing session, day): talk deck, Office image fix, reviewer pass, 1i gate decisions

- Deck images not displayed in PowerPoint: python-pptx output loses most pictures in Office (verified with the Microsoft Graph PDF render: only one picture of 14 shown). LibreOffice re-save (`soffice --headless --convert-to pptx`) fixes it (all picture pages render). Rule: every deck pushed to gtvault is re-saved through LibreOffice first and render-checked through Graph. Builder: scale_out_nsdi/slides/build_khonsu_talk.py (raw build) -> re-save -> khonsu_story.pptx. The sentence-style planning deck is kept as slides/khonsu_planning_notes.pptx.
- Tyler (Sep 6): "no full sentences on a ppt, no semicolons". Deck rebuilt as a talk deck: 25 slides, one-sentence point titles, at most three fragment bullets, one visual, corner status tag (Done/Running/Needed), Question/Experiment/Result blocks removed, detail and caveats in speaker notes. Builder asserts the rules (no semicolons, no sentence-final periods, <= 3 bullets). Tyler's remote edits ported: slide 2 title "Problem", "cooperative prediction" without the hyphen. Pushed to gtvault:khonsu_story.pptx (verify_v15) after the remote matched his last edit.
- Reviewer pass (third external pass, ~8/10, "surgical, not wholesale"): applied to the deck (factual alternatives table with columns State transferred / Trigger / Duplicate work / Publication instead of yes/no; freshness slide reconciles 300 ms Conductor design target vs 600 ms p95 measured age at lightest load and per-scenario tolerable age; "shadow" -> prepared track unpublished, "coasts" -> extrapolates, "arms" -> methods/configurations outside methodology, "warm-and-fresh" split, "at equal correctness" removed, §2 heading "Boundary placement cannot avoid all traffic conflicts", constant-velocity occluded case isolates record content not trigger advantage, collision causal chain in notes). Paper pass delegated to a fork (freshness reconciliation intro + §5.4, factual Table 8, float placement fixes, §4.2 trigger split, §5.1 platform split, terminology sweep, related work and limitations trims). OPEN for Tyler: the reviewer prefers a controlled age-injection sweep for tau(u); Tyler's rule is age through ns-3 only. Not changed; flagged in the deck notes and a % comment in §5.4.
- 1i acceptance gate (eval session): invariant 6 (assoc) fired on cold arms, i.e. tracker tid churn over 40k ticks, not a migration defect -> narrowed to the migrated cid within [prepare, first_use], SKIP on cold. Invariant 7 (coast velocity within 4%) is a real estimator property: exported velocity is the mean over the record's frames (~1.9 s window at flow cadence), lagging the 12 m/s truth (flow 10.36, burst 11.2-11.8); safety outcomes clean on every warm cell -> physical band 15%, estimator fix deferred to freeze-1j, disclosed as a known coast-quality limitation. Confirmed from code: one export path (_export_track_latent) serves both prepare and final update, so MIGRATION_HIST truncates both (intended Experiment A semantics). accel_warm 0/3 stands as the known accel failure for 1j; accel warm cells excluded from tonight's tables. Tag 1i and campaign launch on the gate re-run.
- FREEZE-1i TAGGED = khonsu-eval-freeze-1i -> 868e7066 (code-only; lineage: merge a823e541 of Jordan's branch f012239c/4f7b5150/7adcdd81, code-only revert 8f736384, guarded factorial wiring 868e7066). Gate re-run ALL PASS on 11 merged smokes (inv 6 narrowed, inv 7 at 15%, accel_warm 0/3 DEFER 1j non-blocking; gate change 4b406a94). Factorial smoke on the tag code: hist2 (MIGRATION_HIST=2) 328 B per transfer for both prepare and final update, eps=0, warm before first use; edgewarp_full 776 B full record with the final sync firing x3, eps=0; warm baseline 776 B. Factorial bytes column comes from [OBSTACLE_HANDOFF] bytes. Campaign LAUNCHED Sep 6 on 1i: Atlas A 1-10 -> B 1-10 -> E -> factorial (T23, 10 seeds) -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20 -> faults -> netem (idfix_wt overlay); cetus Table 8 -> N=28 flow -> bo T12 rerun -> matrix 1-5 -> T19b 1-3. Per-block CSVs land in docs/kb/data with the tag column; writing session regenerates floats per block (`make_floats.py --tag freeze-1i`).
- CAMPAIGN LAUNCH REALITY (Sep 6 night, eval session). Atlas A/B/E/F launched via idfix_wt OVERLAY (4 tag files copied onto freeze-1h; freeze-1h pluggable_base+runner are byte-identical to the tag, behavior_agent+worldfusion EM overlaid; the tag's late_fusion + khonsu_shape_check diffs are never touched by flow/burst/factorial). `git checkout` of the tag is NOT used on Atlas because it reverts the working protobuf stubs to the stale tracked versions (AddSerializedFile parse error); the overlay preserves them. Lesson: native tag checkout must be followed by `python -m grpc_tools.protoc` rebuild (the cetus flow does this). First cell hl_warm_r1 confirmed clean (776 B warm handoff, migration live). Factorial F block = fa_one_frame/hist2/hist5 + fb_edgewarpfull/band20/band40 x10. Atlas order (netem removed, moved to cetus): A 1-10 -> B 1-10 -> E -> F -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20 -> faults. Cetus runs the tag NATIVELY (checkout freeze-1i + protoc rebuild) and launched the unambiguous arms: bo T12 lut N-sweep {4,8,12,16,20,24,31}x5 + N=28x5 + Table 8 (burst {warm,edgewarp,cold}x5 + q5 density FLOW_N={2,4,8}x{warm,edgewarp,cold}x5). Cetus tail queued (blocking flock): 5.3 matrix = flow_visible_gt x 6 arms x seeds 1-5 (accel/accel_visible are maneuvering -> deferred to 1j, NOT run on 1i); T19b = paired netem grid (delay,jitter){(0,0),(3,0.5),(20,1),(50,2)}ms x loss{0,0.1,1}% x seeds 1-3, flow warm TRANSFER_MODE=grpc, 3/20ms cells _meas and 50ms/1% _stress, sudo tc cleaned per cell. accel maneuvering excluded from tonight's tables on both machines.
- 1i OVERTAKE REGRESSION -> freeze-1j (Sep 7 eval session). The 1i merged overtake changes (abort-to-lane + recheck-every-tick + lateral-bound lift + Jordan's separate TTC / curved-road removal) made the ego ABORT a committed overtake and steer back into the carlacola truck occluder (carla_id 201): every collided T12 bo run had [OT RECHECK] ABORT=1 and contact actor 201; every no-abort run was clean; N=24 was clean (ABORT=0); design byte-identical warm-migration to 1f (5/5 clean N<=20). Mid-experiment defect (Tyler's rule): 1i QUARANTINED, no CSV in docs/kb/data. freeze-1j = khonsu-eval-freeze-1j = 9ca76adf = behavior_agent.py reverted byte-for-byte to freeze-1h (1f==1h behavior_agent, empty diff), all 1i protocol kept (identity merge, projection, publish gate, MIGRATION_HIST, edgewarp_full, EVAL horizons). 1h->1i protocol delta is inert for warm-flow (EM change is [EVAL]-log-only lines 2230-2242; MIGRATION_HIST guarded + warm never sets it; edgewarp_full unused by warm). Smoke on 1j: bo warm N=4 3/3 clean (rc=0), bo cold collides, burst clean; bo warm N=20 collides 3/3 (rc=0, contact 201). The N=20 collision is a 1f->1h coast-projection anchor change (tracklet.py: 1f pred+=mig_vel*spf*steps from the running predicted bbox -> 1h pred=memo_bank[-1]+mig_vel*spf*steps from the last observed bbox, commit cb9888f4), age-dependent (diverges as steps=coast length=age grows, matching N=4-clean/N=20-collide). It is the real age cliff the corrected coast exposes, not reverted. Decision (A): report the cliff where it lands on 1j. Relaunched both chains on 1j (Atlas A 1-10 first for the 11:00 headline, cetus T12 bo first), 9-run bisect (T12 bo warm N=20 seeds 1-3 on 1f/1g/1h, native checkout+protoc) appended to the end of the cetus tail. Confirmed 1f T12 transfers=7 (migration ON; the "no migration in play" paper/deck wording is wrong). Block A runs at lut_n=scene (native flow load, realized age ~100 ms, network ~22 ms) so warm is clean at the headline. First cells clean on 1j: Atlas hl_warm_r1 ep=0 rc=0; cetus on 9ca76adf. source-vs-destination forecast the ego held is derivable post-hoc (decision tick vs HANDOFFROW first_use_tick: before=source stream, at/after=destination), no code change.
- Paper reviewer pass LANDED (scale_out_nsdi 5f35791, fork): abstract/intro/motivation/design/implementation/evaluation/related_work/limitations/conclusion per the reviewer's list; §5.1 split into Platforms/Closed-loop/Radio/Backhaul/Perception control; §4.2 split into Trigger/Lead time/Early preparation; Table 8 factual (State transferred/Trigger/Duplicate work/Publication); §5.4 short, tau read from the observed onset at sampled loads (5 runs per load), % comment carries the reviewer's controlled-sweep request for Tyler; §5.8 faults moved into Table 11; integrity tag removed from Table 1 (mechanism unverified). Float placement: source order was already at paragraph boundaries; splits came from [t] floats landing at column tops, so all 11 tables are now [H] (float package), 16 pages with placeholders, [t] backup in the fork's scratchpad (contents_t_backup); Tyler's call before the 12-page trim. 29 placeholders remain. architecture.tex and discussion.tex are not \input and still carry old vocabulary. Follow-up commit: Early preparation paragraph now states the transferred velocity is the record-window mean and cites the 1i smoke (10.4 vs 12 m/s at the flow cadence, ~1.9 s window), replacing the single-handoff 0.09 m/s figure.
- Cetus queue decisions (Sep 6): §5.3 matrix tonight = flow_visible_gt only (visible/constant cell), 6 arms x seeds 1-5; both accel cells are maneuvering and go to freeze-1j with the re-commit fix (rows on 1i would be superseded). T19b netem moved from the Atlas tail to cetus: paired grid (delay, jitter) in {(0,0),(3,0.5),(20,1),(50,2)} ms x loss {0,0.1,1}% x seeds 1-3 = 36 runs, flow warm, TRANSFER_MODE=grpc, _meas for 3/20 ms and _stress for 50 ms/1%, lands frozen1i_cetus_netem_rows.csv. Atlas order: A 1-10 -> B 1-10 -> E -> F (factorial: fa_one_frame/hist2/hist5 + fb_edgewarpfull/band20/band40 x10) -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20 -> faults. Cetus order: bo T12 LUT N-sweep x5 -> N=28 flow x5 -> Table 8 (burst + density) -> matrix -> T19b. Cetus CSVs: frozen1i_cetus_{t12bo,n28,t8,matrix,netem}_rows.csv, pulled to Atlas develop per block.

## 2026-09-05 (writing session, night): toy-figure audit against measured rows; batch stopped for a protocol defect

- Tyler asked whether the measured numbers agree with the expected-shape figures. Answer: burst and density agree in direction; the canvas compute curve agrees; unit-level faults agree; the trigger figure's premise (earlier preparation = more warm-before-use, never worse) is contradicted by every lead sweep: v3 + lookahead pilot at-crossing 9/10, 1 s 7/10, 2 s 4/10, 3 s 2/10, 4 s 2/10 clean; frozen1 first rows look 2/3/4 s 0/3 each while 1 s arms 3/3-4/4. Cause found in the frozen code (openscenario_1_flow_gt.py 462-491): the final sync at the crossing is forced only for MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp (T16) or COMMIT_REFRESH=full; default COMMIT_REFRESH=none; every v3 and frozen1 warm row has refresh=none. The Khonsu arm as evaluated omits the FINAL UPDATE + COMMIT of paper §3.4 and publishes an L-second-stale record, while the faithful EdgeWarp arm gets a final sync. The batch was stopped (39 runs, ~3 h lost) for freeze-1b: warm = prepare + final update at the crossing for every trigger and lead; warm_nofinal kept as a named ablation at look {1,2,4} x 10 for §5.5. This also reopens the v3 interpretation rule ("at-crossing transfer suffices on this geometry"): reactive 9/10 vs warm 7/10 may be the missing final update, not geometry. v1 refresh=full rows (10) are uninformative (everything collided on that geometry).
- T12 partial on cetus: blind-overtake clean 5/5 at every delay 0-300 ms so far; the expected cliff (~230 ms from the envelope paper) has not appeared. Asked the eval session for log evidence that AOI_INJECT_MS delays the consumed forecast before trusting the curve.
- FREEZE-1b: tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1b = commit d4f592e6. warm now applies the final update at the crossing (source's latest full record before the destination publishes) for every trigger and lead; warm_nofinal ablation at look {1,2,4} x10. Smoke: 3 final syncs per run; lookahead 4 s recovered to a clean completion where freeze-1 was 0/3 (one la=4 run with 4 episodes = planner launch tail, not staleness). Batch restarted in full on 1b (frozen1b/, ~17 h); freeze-1 rows are not used in any figure. T12 instrumentation: freeze-1 had no age-at-use logging; freeze-1b adds [AOIROW] per tick (inject_ms, delay_ticks, buffer depth, fresh vs served counts, local_undelayed). Structural findings pending the probe: the knob delays edge predictions only (ego local predictions undelayed; in blind-overtake the oncoming should be occluded from the ego), and the planner dead-reckons the oncoming, which compensates pure delay for constant velocity, so the tau(u) cliff is expected in the accel scenario, not blind-overtake. Writing session: if blind-overtake stays flat with the delay verified, extend delays to 700/800/1000 ms so tau(u) is measured; if local bypass covers the oncoming, fix the scenario and rerun T12 in full.
- Cetus chain corrected: the §5.3 completion (c53) had launched on freeze-1 and was killed (warm arm invalid); it now runs on freeze-1b after T12. Cetus tmux chain armed: checkout 1b + rebuild stubs -> AOIROW probe (blind-overtake d0/300/600 + accel d0/300, warm) -> 5.3 completion (occluded/maneuvering x10 + two cells seeds 6-10). T12's 120 runs stay valid (no migration; tag-independent). Atlas frozen1b batch running.
- Tyler (Sep 5 night): T12 age must come through ns-3, not an injected delay. T12 redesigned as the envelope method: sweep radio-plane load levels, log realized age at use per decision, tau(u) from realized age in 50 ms bins, report the load-to-age mapping. The 42 injected-delay runs are pilot only. Paper §5.4 method paragraph rewritten (scale_out_nsdi). The AOIROW probe now serves to show radio-plane age reaching the planner and no undelayed local coverage of the occluded actor. Tyler also noted the 'have' inventory is unchanged from three days ago: this week produced instrumentation, arms, and two defect findings; results regenerate in the 1b batch.
- Utilization accounting (Tyler: "2 machines, 0 data"): Atlas GPU-busy 13.1 h Sep 3, 4.5 h Sep 4, 3.4 h Sep 5 to 18:00 (18.9 h idle gap after Sep 3 22:50 during the pinned-worktree failures; idle overnight Sep 4-5 for lack of a prompt; Sep 5 daytime = builds; freeze-1 39 runs discarded). Cetus: 44 injected-delay T12 runs (pilot). Detection failure analysis (Tyler: "345 runs without detecting it"): geometry defect was invisible in rows (no speed/trigger fields) and misread as a code regression; final-update defect was visible in every row (refresh=none) and read past; common cause: no check tying the paper's arm definitions to the harness configuration. New standing rule: per-batch config sign-off, one row per arm with full effective configuration checked against §5.1 by the writing session before the chain continues; extraction emits final_update (builtin for warm/edgewarp on 1b) and effective ONCOMING_SPEED/TRIGGER_DIST per row. Freeze-1b first rows checked: warm final_syncs=3 transfers=6; edgewarp 3/7; reactive 0/4; kf 0/3, all per §5.1. Both queues chained end to end (Atlas: blocks A-E -> faults x fencing -> netem -> T19b, ~30 h; cetus: T12-injected tail -> 1b checkout -> AOIROW probe -> 5.3 completion, ~13 h; ns-3 T12 chained after characterization). warm_nofinal dropped (Tyler). Netem cells run sudo tc unattended (NOPASSWD, cleanup per cell); Tyler informed. ns-3 T12 pending two checks: whether the ns-3 plane drives edge-to-ego forecast delivery latency (if not: freeze-1c wiring) and the N-to-age mapping at N = 5..60 contending UEs.
- Config sign-off on freeze-1b (from the tag's source): TRIGGER_MODE=mtr fires at p_dst >= THETA with NO lead gate (lines 549-574 fall through to transfer), contrary to §3.2 (probability AND time-to-crossing <= computed L). Fix ordered before block B: add the computed-lead exit test to the mtr branch; tag 1c; restart from block A (~1.5 h lost) because Table 5's Khonsu row is the mtr arm and must share the tag. c_occlconst (flow, ONCOMING_ACCEL=0) duplicates hl_* (flow default ONCOMING_ACCEL=0 in scenario_1.py:131); dropped, hl rows reused. Cell mapping under confirmation: flow = blind overtake (truck occludes) so likely occluded/constant, not visible/constant as the paper's §5.3 currently labels it; accel runner = visible/maneuvering; occluded/maneuvering = flow + ONCOMING_ACCEL=1; visible/constant may have no scenario. kf as run = snapshot content on the forecast trigger without final update; paper §5.1 definition changed to match (scale_out_nsdi). Oracle L = 0.95 s fixed (fold-in + margin), exact for constant-speed actors. Batch env sets ONCOMING_SPEED=12 TRIGGER_DIST=300 explicitly (= contract). Extractor now stamps final_update, oncoming_speed, trigger_dist, eval_tag per row.
- FREEZE-1c = commit 86eac073: mtr trigger now requires theta AND the computed-lead exit test; batch restarted from block A (frozen1c/), tail rebuilt, cetus re-armed on 1c. c_occlconst dropped. §5.3 matrix collapse (eval session, confirmed from the accel XML): both flow and accel contain the carlacola truck occluder, so occluded/constant = flow (hl_ rows), occluded/maneuvering = accel (flow + ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 is the same cell, dropped); visible/constant and visible/maneuvering have no scenario. Writing session ordered no-truck variants of both (6 arms x 10 each) on cetus after T12; paper to label the matrix accordingly. Radio plane finding: the default flow runner uses the ANALYTICAL C-V2X plane (HybridModel on real SEE-V2X trace RTT + SbSpsMac SB-SPS contention, M=20 subchannels), uplink only; downlink forecast delivery is instantaneous with downlink_packet_loss_pct only; the ns-3 5G-LENA co-sim is NOT wired to the flow runner. Measured trace regimes p50/p95: L 11.8/22.3, M 12.3/23.3, H 18.7/23.8 ms (far below the 50-800 ms needed for tau(u)). Options put to Tyler: (a) contention (senders vs subchannels) as the load knob on the analytical plane, no new code, paper platform sentence corrected; (b) wire 5G-LENA to the uplink (new tag, heavier runs); (c) synthetic stress, not recommended. Writing session recommends (a). Eval session characterizing senders-to-age and estimating (b) meanwhile; cetus runs probe + 5.3.
- Visible-row variants built (flow_visible, accel_visible: truck occluder removed) and queued on cetus after T12 -> probe -> accel occl/maneuv seeds 6-10; visible rows labeled eval_tag=freeze-1c+vis (additive files, occluded arms unaffected; no rerun). Senders-to-realized-age on the analytical C-V2X plane (SB-SPS M=20, tick 50 ms, SEE-V2X RTT p50 14.3 ms, 3000-tick sim): N=5 p50 14 / p95 564 ms; N=10 14/1017; N=15 64/1664; N=20 314/2167; N=25 414/2814; N=30 614/3364; N=40 814/3614. Proposed T12 levels N={5,15,20,25,30,35,40}; needs MAC_BG_SENDERS knob (phantom contenders), ~30 min, tag freeze-1d, being built now so (a) launches on Tyler's word. (b) 5G-LENA estimate: source exists (nr_v2x_cosim_server.cc) but unwired and unbuilt; ~half day + validation and 2-5x slower runs (10-20 min/run), prohibitive at T12 scale before Sep 17. Awaiting Tyler's (a)/(b) call; T12 not launched; cetus busy on probe + 5.3 + visible.
- freeze-1d = commit a092f50e (additive over 1c: MAC_BG_SENDERS default 0, AGEROW log-only; Atlas frozen1c batch unaffected). Knob validated standalone: real-sender delivery 89.3% at bg=0, 32.0% at bg=20, 13.4% at bg=40. AGEROW at the edge publish path logs realized_age_ms = (tick - latest ingested source tick) x dt, so load-to-age and tau(u) come from the same runs. T12 script ready and HELD pending Tyler's (a)/(b): 2 scenarios x N={5,15,20,25,30,35,40} x 5 seeds = 70 runs, ~6.5 h.
- CORRECTION (Tyler: Conductor and the envelope evals ran off ns-3): they did. ecav/core/application/edge/latency/ns3_lut_sampler.py + data/ns3_{uplink,downlink}_lut.csv (N in {4,8,16,24,31} x payload {1000,16896} B; mean/p50/p95/p99/max/prr; bilinear interpolation) are wired into the late-fusion and WorldFusion AB3DMOT edge managers (use_ns3_lut); KB 2026-05-31: envelope matrix = controlled latency with the ns-3 Uu LUT (UL+DL) as the network-validation scatter. The 5G-LENA co-sim server binary exists (built Apr 24) and ran in June via channel_engine/harbor_manager (V2V). Only the Khonsu flow runner's edge manager lacks the LUT. LUT ranges: UL p50 9.6-37.8 ms; DL p50 5.3-304 ms, p95 to 952 ms at N=31 with the 16.9 KB payload. My statement to Tyler that 'the closed loop does not run ns-3' was too broad and is withdrawn. T12 redesigned: wire use_ns3_lut into the flow runner's edge manager (pattern of the AB3DMOT managers), tag freeze-1e, sweep N={4,8,12,16,20,24,31} x 2 scenarios x 5 seeds, realized age from AGEROW, tau(u) by 50 ms bins; MAC_BG_SENDERS knob dropped; tau(u) above the top LUT cell reported as a lower bound.
- Tyler: the ns-3 radio plane is REQUIRED in every closed-loop run. Finding: all 20 Khonsu yamls use manager_type worldfusion_mamba_adaptive (edge_manager_worldfusion_mamba_mtr.py, created 2026-07-31), which inherits WorldFusionAdaptiveEdge (edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_mtr_adaptive.py); that lineage never received the ns-3 LUT wiring that edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py got on 2026-04-30 (use_ns3_lut default True; UL sample at ingest, DL sample per publish into a latest-wins outbound queue). Consequence: every Khonsu closed-loop run to date (v1-v3, q5, freeze-1/1b/1c) ran without the ns-3 radio plane (HybridModel trace uplink, instant downlink), contrary to the paper's §5.1 platform description. Order to the eval session: wire UL+DL LUT into the adaptive lineage (default on, N = live vehicle count, actual payload), log ul_ms/dl_ms per event, tag freeze-1e, restart the batch from block A (restart four), re-arm tail and cetus chains on 1e, T12 on 1e with LUT N as the load axis; per-arm config rows must show use_ns3_lut=on before the batch continues.
- SECOND CORRECTION (verified in code): the adaptive manager's run_step calls super().run_step(tick) (edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_mtr_adaptive.py:171) and neither the adaptive nor the mamba subclass adds delivery/latency code, so the base WorldFusionEdge's ns-3 LUT sampling (use_ns3_lut default True; UL at ingest, DL into the latest-wins outbound queue) IS live in every Khonsu run, including frozen1c. The 'adaptive lineage lacked it' entry above is wrong (per-file grep missed inheritance). Restart four rescinded; frozen1c batch stands. freeze-1e = commit 318bb299 adds only NS3_LUT_N override (T12 load axis) and AGEROW at the outbound drain (realized age = UL staleness + compute + DL); MAC_BG_SENDERS dropped. T12 signed off and ordered launched on cetus ahead of the probe. frozen1c rows carry no AGEROW (age at use not extractable for the headline batch; warm-before-first-use and bytes are). Paper §5.1 platform sentence now says the radio plane samples per-message UL/DL latency and reception ratio from an ns-3 5G-LENA C-V2X lookup table indexed by vehicle count and payload (scale_out_nsdi).
- Status after the rescind: frozen1c batch had been killed ~10 s before the rescind arrived, restarted immediately (resumable; one in-flight run lost, ~5 min); tail re-armed; frozen1c stands as the headline/trigger tag. T12 LAUNCHED on cetus on freeze-1e (318bb299) ahead of the probe and 5.3: flow + accel x NS3_LUT_N={4,8,12,16,20,24,31} x 5 = 70 runs, realized age from AGEROW. Injected-delay pilot (51 logs) stopped, not in the paper. 5.3 completion and visible row run on 1e (additive over 1c; accepted, same pooling justification). Both machines ~100% busy. Next landings: first T12 AGEROW UL/DL sample, then block A.
- Tyler's reminder: the inter-locale transfer is over the WIRED backhaul. Finding: openscenario_1_flow_gt.py:320 builds InterLocaleLink(edge_list[0].latency_model), so the migration's accounted network cost is sampled from the source edge's C-V2X radio model (wrong medium); the cost never delays the mechanism (link.py is accounting only) but feeds the computed trigger's EMA (lines 658-659) and LEADROW/XFERROW; the '40 ms measured median transfer' EMA seed is therefore a radio number. Lead effect < 0.05 s; frozen1c batch not invalidated. No 5G-MOBIX reference exists in code, KB, or paper; the codebase's wired parameters are v2x_network_model (2 ms base, 1 Gbps fiber) and channel_engine/ns3_bridge backhaul_queue_delay_ms (100 Mbps queue). Order: give InterLocaleLink a wired backhaul model (base + bytes/bandwidth + queue), reseed the EMA, for T8/freeze-2 and later; netem levels held until a citable wired-backhaul measurement is chosen (Tyler points at 5G-MOBIX).
- Wired backhaul grounding: 5G-MOBIX D5.2 v3.0 §4.5.4 (CS_14): MEC-to-MEC over fibre 100 km apart, one-way avg 1.8-3.6 ms, median 1.6-3.6, p95 2.4-3.7, max 3.6-5.2, stdev 0.1-0.8 ms (Table 30); 11 km fibre federation added no measurable delay (NL); inter-operator leased line adds 15-20 ms per hop (summary bullet); wired packet loss zero. Ordered: InterLocaleLink wired model base 3 ms + 0.5 ms jitter + serialization + bytes/1 Gbps + queue; EMA reseeded; netem matrix one-way delay {0,3,20,50} ms with jitter {0,0.5,1,2}, loss {0,0.1,1}% (3 and 20 = measured operating points; 50 ms and 1% = labeled stress). Paper: bib entry mobix_d52; §4.2 Transport and §5.8 network sensitivity cite it (scale_out_nsdi). Sources: D5.2 PDF at 5g-mobix.com; 5G-PPP joint white paper (5G-MOBIX/5G-CARMEN/5GCroCo, May 2023) for the inter-MEC statement.
- Wired link landed on develop (freeze-2/T8 code): InterLocaleLink base 3 ms + 0.5 ms gaussian jitter + serialization + payload/1 Gbps + 0.5x queue term; EMA reseeded ~3 ms; env BACKHAUL_BASE_MS/JITTER_MS/BW_MBPS, TRANSFER_MEDIUM=wired default. netem matrix rebuilt: (delay,jitter) = (0,0),(3,0.5),(20,1),(50,2) ms x loss {0,0.1,1}% = 12 cells x 3 reps, real gRPC, rows tagged _meas (3, 20 ms) or _stress (50 ms, 1%), sudo tc cleaned per cell; queued in the Atlas tail after the fault arms. frozen1c and T12 unaffected (accounting only).
- T12 first sample (t12_lut_rows.csv; blind-overtake N=4, seeds 1-3, all clean): AGEROW realized age at use p50 300 ms, p95 600 ms. FINDING: age at use has a ~300 ms FLOOR at the lightest load, quantized at ~150 ms steps (edge cadence 0.2 s + jitter buffer + DL queue), so the freshness axis starts at the cadence floor, not 50 ms; the pipeline cannot forecast from data fresher than its own cadence. Decision (writing session): tau(u) is on total age at use (the paper's Delta_use); a second field network_age_ms (UL+DL LUT delay only) feeds the load-to-age table; the floor is stated as a result; per-decision rows requested if cheap. The 776 B / 35-65 ms transfer numbers in T12 logs are radio-medium accounting (freeze-1e predates the wired fix) and do not affect T12. frozen1c_rows.csv lands on block A's marker with B-E appended; fault and T19b landers built to the checker's columns.
- freeze-1f = 7c28b753: AGEROW logs per decision both realized_age_ms (total Delta_use) and network_age_ms (UL+DL LUT only). T12 restarted on cetus at 1f (t12_lut_1f; the 1e N=4 rows are pilot). Landings: t12_lut_rows.csv (per-run p50/p95 of both ages) and t12_lut_decisions.csv (one row per planner decision: scenario, ns3_lut_n, realized_age_ms, network_age_ms, run_collided) so tau(u) is computed over decisions at each age. Floor (~300 ms, ~150 ms steps) recorded in the KB README as a result. Chains: Atlas frozen1c (block-lander writes frozen1c_rows.csv per marker) -> faults -> netem -> T19b; cetus T12(1f) -> probe -> 5.3 -> visible.
- BLOCK A LANDED (frozen1c_rows.csv, 60 rows, freeze-1c, atlas, 12/300): clean runs warm (fixed 1 s + final update) 9/10, reactive 9/10, handover_snapshot 3/10, cold 1/10, kf 0/10, edgewarp 0/10. Shape check: headline AGREE. Bytes/run: warm 4800 (prepare + final update), reactive 2488, edgewarp 1714 (pre-copy + sync), kf 864, snapshot 782, cold 48 (queried). Extractor stamps final_update=none on 1c warm/edgewarp (label bug keyed to the 1b tag; fix requested). EdgeWarp 0/10 below handover_snapshot 3/10: import path of pre-copy + delta under review before block B ends (fix-and-rerun that arm if defective). Paper: Table 5 rewritten from block A; §5.3 factors restated as ego visibility (truck) x motion; flow = occluded/constant; accel and visible cells placeholders; Khonsu forecast-trigger row pending block B (scale_out_nsdi).
- Block A follow-ups: extractor final_update stamp fixed (was keyed to the '1b' substring), frozen1c_rows.csv re-landed (64 rows) with builtin for warm/edgewarp. EdgeWarp import path checked: pre-copy (tick 53) and final sync (tick 55) import to the same mamba tid; the sync replaces the pre-copy; effective lead ~2 ticks, so edgewarp and handover_snapshot are both fresh-snapshot arms and 0/10 vs 3/10 is n=10 noise; no rerun. cold 48 B/run = the ego's own ownership token (present in every arm; exclude from bytes per crossing). HANDOFFROW summary landed (frozen1c_handoff_summary.csv): warm_before_first_use 1.000 for warm/kf/reactive/handover_snapshot, 0.909 edgewarp. FINDING: realized prepare-to-crossing lead is 0.05-0.12 s for every configured LOOKAHEAD (1-4 s): the occluded oncoming is detected only near the boundary, so the lead is detection-capped, and the trigger table's lead axis on the occluded flow scenario cannot separate leads. Open questions to the eval session: per-handoff lead distribution (not mean); what then made freeze-1 look 2/3/4 collapse to 0/3 vs look 1 3/3; whether the source RSU itself sees the oncoming only in the last 50-120 ms (which would change the paper's 'source observes the actor to the crossing' and make the scenario the strongest case); confirm the visible variants give 1-4 s leads and add a visible-flow trigger block (7 arms x 5) to cetus.
- RETRACTION (eval session, verified against look-sweep x positions): the 'detection-capped ~0.1 s lead' was a metric artifact. HANDOFFROW crossing_tick is destination ENTRY (x>240) while the trigger targets source EXIT (x>250); the 10 m overlap makes prepare-to-entry ~0.1 s. True prepare-to-source-exit lead at LOOKAHEAD 1 s: warm/kf/edgewarp median 0.88 s, reactive/handover 0.79 s; prepare fires at x = 239/227/215/202 for look 1/2/3/4 = 0.9/1.9/2.9/4.0 s (frozen1c_truelead_summary.csv). Freeze-1 collapse explained: without the final update the record was stale by the full lead (2-4 s) at use; look 1 (1 s stale) tolerable; validates the final-update fix. Source RSU tracks the oncoming continuously from spawn (truck is east of the actor); the paper's 'source observes the actor to the crossing' holds; occluded scenario is the strong case. Visible variants kept only for the visibility cell; no visible-lead block. Metric fix (source_exit_tick in HANDOFFROW) queued for freeze-2. Open: the first block B look-2 s run collided with the final update (0/1); if look 2/3/4 collapse on 1c, stop-and-diagnose (is the final update applied before the destination's first publish; record staleness at first use).
- Block B watch: staleness path ruled out on freeze-1c (look2 r1: prepare 44, final update 55, first_dst_track 45, first_use 65, age at use ~0.5 s; final update applied before first use). look2 r1 = 1 episode/1 contact tick (counts as collided under the binary rule), look3 r1 clean, look4 r1 4 episodes; warm r1 3 episodes. The eval session's manual 'all collided' read used a grep that matched near-miss lines; the extractor and gate use the correct collision-sensor regex, so banked rows are correct. Open: the 'residual planner launch tail' (contacts at scenario launch, ~10-20% of runs in every arm) is a scenario artifact; facts requested (which actor, tick, position, per-arm rate, arm-independence). If confirmed, it is a known scenario defect; fixing it and rerunning freeze-1c is Tyler's call.
- 'Launch tail' characterized (eval session): every frozen1c first contact is ego vs the STOPPED TRUCK (x=278) during the overtake launch (ego x 278-293, speed 0-6 m/s); the overtake is gated on the oncoming forecast, so a poor forecast leaves the ego creeping beside the truck into contact. Per-arm contact rate: warm 1/10, reactive 1/10, handover_snapshot 7/10, cold 9/10, kf 10/10, edgewarp 10/10: arm-dependent, i.e. the safety result itself, NOT an arm-independent artifact; noise framing retracted. Success (completed & no contact): warm 9, reactive 9, handover_snapshot 2, cold 1, kf 0, edgewarp 0. Only the ~10% residual on the good arms is a launch-imperfection floor (Tyler's call whether to reduce it; recommendation: leave it, stated). Paper Table 5 handover snapshot success corrected 3->2/10; mechanism sentence added.
- BLOCK B LANDED (Sep 6 01:53, frozen1c_rows.csv): clean/10: oracle 10, mtr 9, computed 8, fixed 1 s 9 (hl_warm), 2 s 8, 3 s 9, 4 s 4; all with the final update; ~7 transfers and ~4.8 KB per run in every warm arm. Shape check: lead DISAGREE at 3->4 s. Diagnosis requested before block D: (a) destination publishing the prepared track before commit, (b) prepared track aged out or re-associated before the final update, (c) staleness at first use for look 4 vs 1, (d) whether the collapse is confined to leads above the 2.5 s cap (computed/mtr never exceed it). Paper: Table 5 Khonsu row is now the mtr arm (9/10); Table 6 held until the 4 s diagnosis lands. True lead at LOOKAHEAD 1: warm/kf/edgewarp median 0.88 s, reactive/handover 0.79 s.
- 4 s COLLAPSE DIAGNOSED (eval session, code + logs): the T7 ownership shadow (ownership.py publishable/epoch/PREPARED) is not wired into any edge publish path (zero OwnershipManager imports in edge_manager_*), so the destination publishes the IMPORTED track immediately and consumers receive forecasts for it before the final update/commit. Evidence look4 npc200: prepare 91, first_use 105, commit 156: the ego consumed the prepared, coasted record for 2.5 s before commit. Short leads (~1 s: hl_warm, computed, mtr, oracle) have a short pre-commit window and are nearly unaffected; the 2.5 s computed cap was guarding exactly this. Contradicts paper §3.4 (IMPORT does not publish) and §3.5 (epoch e+1 only after COMMIT). DECISION (writing session under Tyler's fix-and-rerun rule, 02:xx Sep 6): wire the publish gate (publish only when publishable: owner or committed destination; PUBGATE log per suppressed publish), smoke (warm look1/look4, reactive; assert first_use > commit for every migrated track), tag freeze-1g, restart the batch from block A (restart five, ~9 h of 1c runs lost); frozen1c logs kept intact so Tyler can override by resuming 1c. T12 on cetus unaffected (no migration); 5.3/visible move to 1g. Tyler notified by push.
- FREEZE-1g = commit 515136be: publish gate wired. Imported track is a shadow (dst_edge._shadow_obstacles) until the physical crossing (locale.contains) clears it for every arm; the linear-predictor publish path filters shadow ids and logs [PUBGATE] per suppressed publish. Commit = physical crossing for all arms; the content final update stays warm/edgewarp-only. Smoke passed: warm look4 first_use > commit for all three migrated tracks (61>55, 161>156, 263>257; PUBGATE 21x for the long leads), warm look1 and reactive clean with PUBGATE 0; (b) nailed: no age-out/re-association. look4 4->2 episodes at n=1. Batch restarted from block A on 1g (frozen1g/), tail and block-lander re-armed; frozen1c logs preserved (resumable if Tyler overrides). T12 continues on 1f; 5.3/visible re-tag to 1g after T12. Paper §4.2 Import states the shadow gate.
- BLOCK A on freeze-1g LANDED (Sep 6 06:43, frozen1g_rows.csv, 60 rows, 12/300): success/10: warm (1 s + final update, shadow-gated) 9, reactive 8, cold 2, kf 1, edgewarp 1, handover_snapshot 0. Bytes/run: warm 4939, reactive 2472, edgewarp 1675, kf 848, snapshot 816, cold 48 (ego token). Shape check: headline AGREE. Paper Table 5 moved to 1g (Khonsu row = fixed 1 s until 1g block B lands, then the mtr arm). frozen1c rows are superseded for every figure.
- BLOCK B on freeze-1g LANDED (Sep 6 10:23): fixed leads 1 s 9/10, 2 s 9/10, 3 s 9/10, 4 s 5/10 (mtr/computed/oracle rows in the same file; see the next landing note). The publish gate removed the pre-commit leak (look4 was 4/10 on 1c) but the 4 s collapse remains: a second mechanism. Diagnosis requested: gate held? ego hit the truck? destination compute/budget gating during the 4 s shadow window (wall-clock path; would make long leads cost destination compute, a systems reason for the 2.5 s cap); how the ego merges forecasts from two edges (runner has no binding code); whether the final update replaces or updates the coasted shadow's banks; source keeps publishing the NPC (obstacle transfer is a share, no ownership move, per the runner docstring). Table 6 held.
- 1g block B full tallies (success/10): computed 9, mtr 7, oracle 8, fixed 1 s 9, 2 s 9, 3 s 9, 4 s 5; ~4.8 KB/run all. Versus 1c: mtr 9->7, oracle 10->8, computed 8->9: within ten-seed noise (+-2), no mechanism claimed. Consequence: at n=10 the design arm (mtr) cannot be separated from the fixed 1 s lead or from reactive (8). Writing-session proposal to Tyler: seeds 11-20 for the six headline arms and the mtr/computed/oracle arms on cetus after T12 (~90 runs, ~8 h) so Tables 5-6 have 20 seeds. Table 5 keeps the fixed 1 s Khonsu row until then; Table 6 held on the 4 s diagnosis.
- look-4 SECOND MECHANISM (eval session, collided vs clean): the migrated track coasts at the migrated velocity through the lead; at 4 s it drifts ~18 m (collided r1: coasted tid=1 at x=175 vs true oncoming x=156), beyond the tracker's 8 m match gate (lost_match_dist_m), so the destination's native re-detection at the crossing fails to associate and creates a duplicate track (both cid=200); the ego's per-carla_id latest-wins cache flip-flops between the drifted and native forecasts, the overtake gate mis-decides, and the ego grinds the truck. Clean look4 runs: drift < 8 m, single tid. Gate held on all 10 (no first_use<commit); compute secondary (collided 1.05 vs 0.34 compute/veh-s); source keeps publishing (share, no ownership move). Paper mismatch: §3.5 step 4 says association by stable ID; the tracker associates by position. Options to Tyler: (1) fix (identity merge; replace-on-final-update; rerun look2/3/4 + hl_warm x10 on a new tag, compare hl_warm to 1g) recommended by the writing session; (2) report (position-gated association in §3.5; look4 = cap justification). Eval session preparing the identity merge on a branch; no restart until Tyler picks. Open: eval session contradiction on whether the final update replaces (same tid) or appends.
- Replace-vs-append reconciled (1g warm headline, cid=199): inject_latent_into_tracker appends at code level (no dedup) but at short lead the position-gated association merges the same-tid, same-position objects on the next tick, so only tid=2 ever carries cid=199 (no persistent duplicate); the look4 duplicate is a different thing: native re-detection gets a new tid (7) because the migrated tid (1) coast-drifted ~18 m past the 8 m gate. Fix on a branch (not tagged): (a) inject replaces the same-tid tracklet; (b) identity-aware association (native detection with the same stable id merges into the migrated track, position gate otherwise, per §3.5 step 4). Smoke plan: look4 (no dup tid), warm look1 + reactive (identical to 1g). Awaiting Tyler: fix vs report; 20 seeds.
- Tyler (Sep 6 midday): FIX the association (identity merge + replace-on-inject; the committee's identity-disagreement failure at a merge point) and 20 seeds for the core tables. Plan sent: smoke -> tag freeze-1h; Atlas finishes block C on 1g (Table 8 = 1g figure), then stops before block D and runs on 1h: A headline 6x20, B trigger 7x20, E theta x5 (~285 runs, ~22 h), then faults/netem/T19b on 1h; cetus: T12 (1f) -> probe -> full §5.3 non-headline matrix on 1h at 10 seeds (accel, flow_visible, accel_visible; 180 runs, ~16.5 h); block D dropped from Atlas; corridor smoke Sep 8-9, go/no-go Sep 9.
- Tyler adds TIMESTAMP PROJECTION to the fix: the shadow track's pose at any tick = record pose + record velocity x (tick_now - record_tick) in the destination frame, re-anchored each tick (not integrated from the tracker's own predictions); the same projection at association time; identity merge primary; final update replaces on the same tid. Eval session first to explain the 18 m / 4 s drift on a 12 m/s constant-velocity actor (velocity magnitude/frame error vs compounding), then report residual drift at commit, duplicate tids, and first post-commit forecast displacement on look4 after the fix.
- Drift explanation (code-verified): the shadow coast already projects from the record (pred = memo_bank[-1] + mig_vel x spf x (tsu+1); memo_bank[-1] is the last observed pose, never mutated), so the ~18 m overshoot is a velocity-magnitude or spf/steps scaling error, not compounding; mig_vel was not logged, so the magnitude is not asserted; [COASTROW] added (vel magnitude, frame, spf, steps, projected pose). Fix on branch idfix-assoc (844ea3fe): (a) explicit record-anchored projection + COASTROW; (b) position gate against the projected pose; (c) identity merge primary (_merge_duplicate_carla_ids: same carla_id -> keep longer history, adopt fresh pose, drop dup, [IDMERGE]); (d) inject replaces the same-tid tracklet. Smoke armed (blockC_then_smoke.sh): waits for 1g _blockC_done, stops the 1g chain before block D, runs warm look1/look4 + reactive; then freeze-1h tag, config rows, ETAs.
- CETUS CHAIN DEAD (found Sep 6 13:21): every accel T12 run core-dumped ('timeout: the monitored command dumped core'), last at Sep 5 23:53; the tmux chain exited with the first crash; cetus idle 13.5 h. Blind-overtake half of T12 intact (35 finished). Orders: reproduce one accel run by hand with the core enabled and get the traceback (cetus-specific asset/extension/config for openscenario_1_accel_gt), relaunch from the accel half under a chain that survives child crashes, [STALL] markers and a message on any chain exit. Writing session armed an independent liveness watch (no sim process on Atlas or cetus for 20 min -> event). Lesson: my landed-rows watch cannot see a dead chain; liveness is a separate signal.
- CORRECTION: the cetus chain did not hang; it ran to completion at Sep 5 23:53 (through the visible rows, last run vis_maneuv_cold_r10). Every accel and visible run crashed at TEARDOWN (PyGILState_Release after a double ego destroy, cetus-specific, exposed by accel's early completion at ~16.7 s) AFTER the eval dict, collision stream, and AGEROW were written; only RUNROW and the clean exit are lost. Decision: salvage (A) with validation on Atlas accel logs that have both eval dict and RUNROW (fallback must reproduce every RUNROW field), and the clean-exit mitigation goes into freeze-1h. The cetus 5.3/visible rows on 1f are pre-gate/pre-fix: discarded; the matrix reruns on 1h. Cetus idles until the 1h tag unless the accel salvage fails (then rerun the T12 accel half on 1f with the mitigation). Liveness watch stays armed.
- Tyler (Sep 6 14:00): why is the load sweep so late. Closed-loop load = block C (density + burst, landing today) plus per-run HANDOFFROW/COMPUTEROW; T19b (platoon 1-16 x 4 arms, p99 latency figure) was queued behind faults/netem in the Atlas tail. Reordered: T19b runs on cetus right after the 1h matrix (~Mon 08:00 -> ~17:00); Atlas tail = A -> B -> E -> faults -> netem.
- STALE ACCEL RUNNER (found Sep 6 15:00): openscenario_1_accel_gt.py (and accel_visible) were separate copies that never received the flow runner's instrumentation (no RUNROW/HANDOFFROW/AGEROW/PUBGATE/COASTROW) nor the 1b-1g fixes (no final update, gate, projection). T12 accel realized age was never captured -> reruns on the regenerated runner; 5.3 accel cells rerun on 1h (already planned). Fix on idfix-assoc 18b6b9a8: both accel runners regenerated from the flow runner (differ only by configFile). Fallback extractor validated on flow (120/120). Smoke adds accel_warm. Chains: Atlas 1h A 6x20 -> B 7x20 -> E -> faults -> netem; cetus 1h T12 accel (first) -> 5.3 matrix -> T19b. New sign-off rule: runner identity + instrumentation signature per runner; corridor runners listed before its smoke.
- Runner-signature rule applied to the corridor: openscenario_1_corridor_gt.py (t13-corridor branch) is STALE (RUNROW + HANDOFFROW + SCENB only; no runner-side 1e-1g/idfix changes: publish-gate wiring, shadow clear, EMA seed, mtr lead gate, wired backhaul); generated from flow at ~freeze-1c. Must be regenerated from the freeze-1h flow runner with the N-locale surgery re-applied (_dest_locale_for resolver, crossing_idx HANDOFFROW, corridor loop) before its smoke. Corridor files: the runner (regenerate), openscenario_1_corridor_gt.yaml (4 locales A-D), scenario_1_corridor.xml. Split noted: AGEROW/COASTROW/PUBGATE come from shared edge/tracker code (any current-tag run emits them); RUNROW/HANDOFFROW are runner-side. Sign-off rows will carry the 5-marker presence + generation commit per runner. 1h tag, rows, ETAs come with the post-block-C smoke.
- BLOCK C on 1g LANDED (Sep 6 14:33): density AGREE (warm 5/5, 3/5, 5/5 at N=2/4/8; edgewarp 0; cold 1/1/0) but BURST collapsed: warm 0/5, edgewarp 0/5, cold 0/5 (warm was 5/5 pre-gate). Hypothesis: in burst the ego is served by the destination locale and, with the publish gate, receives no forecast for the platoon until each vehicle crosses (pre-gate it received the destination's prepared forecasts early); in flow the ego is served by the source, so the gate costs nothing. Design gap vs §3.5 (the epoch rule presumes consumers receive the owner's forecast across the boundary until commit). Fix ordered into idfix before the 1h tag: the destination FORWARDS the source's current forecast for a prepared track with the source's epoch e until commit (forwarding is not publishing); planner keeps highest-epoch; shared edge code so every arm gets it; smoke burst warm (>=4/5), burst cold (0/5), flow warm look1 (==1g), reactive; Table 8 moves to 1h (block C reruns on cetus after T12 accel). Tag HELD.
- BURST COLLAPSE ROOT CAUSE (eval session, 1g burst_warm_r1): the burst runner was STALE (regenerated from flow at 2e5ea710 ~freeze-1c; RUNROW+SCENB only; no HANDOFFROW/AGEROW/PUBGATE and no t19_crossing shadow-clear), so the shared publish gate suppressed the platoon shadows forever (813 PUBGATE suppressions, cids 199-204; 10 episodes, 843 contact ticks). Ego is in locale_0 (the destination) in BOTH flow and burst, so the source/destination distinction does not separate them; flow is 9/10 because its runner clears shadows at crossing. The forwarding hypothesis is NOT adopted unless burst warm is still <4/5 on the regenerated runner; the §3.4 forwarding sentence was reverted (scale_out_nsdi). Burst runner regenerated on idfix-assoc; smoke adds burst warm/cold with first-consumed-minus-crossing ticks and min TTC; tag still held. Third stale runner (accel, corridor, burst): the signature rule catches all of them.
- BURST COLLAPSE ROOT CAUSE (eval session, 1g burst_warm_r1): the burst runner was STALE (regenerated from flow at 2e5ea710 ~freeze-1c; RUNROW+SCENB only; no HANDOFFROW/AGEROW/PUBGATE and no t19_crossing shadow-clear), so the shared publish gate suppressed the platoon shadows forever (813 PUBGATE suppressions, cids 199-204; 10 episodes, 843 contact ticks). Ego is in locale_0 (the destination) in BOTH flow and burst; flow is 9/10 because its runner clears shadows at crossing. Forwarding NOT adopted unless burst warm is still <4/5 on the regenerated runner; the §3.4 forwarding sentence was reverted. Burst runner regenerated on idfix-assoc; smoke adds burst warm/cold with first-consumed-minus-crossing ticks and min TTC; tag held. Third stale runner (accel, corridor, burst): the signature rule catches all of them.
- While the tag is held (Sep 6 afternoon): paper float pipeline built (scale_out_nsdi scripts/make_floats.py): Table 5 rows, trigger rows, density rows generated from the newest tag's rows into contents/gen_tab_*_rows.tex and \input by the tables; fig_density.pdf and fig_envelope.pdf generated from CSVs; limitations updated for the identity merge; §5.8 burst text replaced by a placeholder until 1h; density text on 1g. Eval session: duplicate smoke chains briefly caused contention; cleaned and relaunched under flock (single instance); 1g block D killed (invalid on 1g). frozen1g_trigger_lead_summary.csv landed: median true lead hl_warm 0.88, computed 0.84, mtr 0.74, oracle 0.84, look2 1.88, look3 2.83, look4 3.91 s; warm-before-first-use 0.97-1.00. Per-handoff rows requested for the lead CDF. CPU queue: T9 harness on 1g, T22 script, corridor runner regen with the N-locale surgery re-applied.
- Landed: t12_lut_rows.csv (1f, blind-overtake half, 35 runs, with network_age_p50_ms) + t12_lut_decisions.csv (12,879 per-decision rows); frozen1g_handoffs.csv (334 per-migrated-track rows: arm, run, track, true_lead_s, warm_before_first_use, bytes). Realized age p50/p95 flat ~300/600 ms across N (cadence floor dominates); network age p50 climbs with N (~53 ms at N=12). Paper float pipeline fixed (whole-tabular generation; f-string brace bug); Table 5 and the density table are generated files now; envelope figure regenerated from the full bo sweep. 1h block-lander will also land per-handoff rows per block.
- T12 blind-overtake (1f landed): all 35 runs collided=no; per-decision bins clean up to 2000 ms of age; realized p50 300/300/300/300/400/450/600 ms and network p50 26/36/53/70/155/224/286 ms at N=4/8/12/16/20/24/31. Under the paper rule tau(bo) is a LOWER BOUND above the reachable range (dead reckoning compensates pure delay for a constant-velocity target; the cliff is expected in the maneuvering scenario). DISCREPANCY to reconcile: the 00:47 direct read of the 1f logs showed bo_n31 with 2 runs having episodes>0 (3/5 clean); asked the eval session for per-seed episodes/eps_raw/contact ticks vs the emitted collided flag. §5.4 text held on this.
- T12 RECONCILED: the landed CSV's collided column was wrong (inline extractor regex matched nothing); RUNROW is authoritative: N=31 s1 and s4 collided (episodes 1, contact ticks 30), all other 33 runs clean. Corrected in place. Per level: success 5/5 at N=4..24, 3/5 at N=31; p50 300/300/300/300/400/450/600 ms; p95 600/600/600/600/600/800/1200 ms; network p50 26/36/53/70/155/224/286 ms. The failing seeds have LOWER p50 (400) than the clean N=31 seeds (600) but the heaviest tails; NS3_LUT_N is LUT-only so the scene is identical across levels: the TAIL of the age breaks the maneuver. Paper §5.4 now states the rule on per-run p95 age in 100 ms bins, tau(overtake) = 800 ms (highest all-clean level), onset at p95 1.2 s; fig_envelope included; accel joins on the regenerated runner. Shape checker and make_floats moved to p95. Contact-window ages requested. Rule: landed collided columns come only from the general extractor (eps>0).
- Freshness rule aligned (paper eq:tau, checker, make_floats): tau(u) = the largest p95 age bin (100 ms) below which no run fails (monotone reading). Blind overtake: bins 600:23/23, 700:1/1, 800:5/5, 1000:1/1, 1100:0/1, 1200:3/4 -> tau(overtake) = 1.0 s, first failure at p95 1.15 s (the earlier 800 ms figure was the highest all-clean LEVEL, superseded). Checker's rise test ignores bins with fewer than 3 runs. Atlas idle since 14:43 (smoke not launched); eval session told to launch and confirm.
- Smoke live at 15:06 (idfix_wt/evaluation_outputs/idfix_smoke/, cells warm_look1, warm_look4, reactive, accel_warm, burst_warm, burst_cold; progress.txt, status.txt). Idle root cause: blockC_then_smoke.sh gated on frozen1g/_blockC_done, which the batch (killed at 14:43) never wrote; replaced by idfix_smoke_now.sh (flock, no gate). All four idfix fixes present in the worktree; three runners pass the currency diff (0 non-SCENARIO_NAME lines vs flow). t12_lut_decisions.csv run_collided corrected (N=31 s1/s4). Eval session asked to align its README to the monotone tau rule (1.0 s).
- Freshness statistic SETTLED (after the eval session showed no N=31 run has p95 1.0 s and that failed runs' whole-run p95 includes post-contact samples): per run, the MAX realized age consumed before the first contact (whole run if none), realized_age_max_precontact_ms; tau(u) = largest 100 ms bin of it below which no run fails. Data: all runs with max <= 1000 ms complete (N<=24; N=31 s2/s3), at 1200 ms s5 completes and s1/s4 fail (contact at edge tick 236; window p50 600-800, max 1200) -> tau(overtake) = 1.0 s, onset 1.2 s. Ordered: the column in t12_lut_rows.csv, README aligned, NS3_LUT_N=28 x5 after the accel T12 to sample the 800-1150 ms band. Paper definition, figure axis, and checker switched to this statistic.
- Freshness statistic FINAL: the literal 'max age before first contact' is non-monotone (clean N=31 runs spike to 1400-2000 ms early in the approach, t=447-538, while failures are at 1200-1250), so the statistic is age_at_maneuver = max realized age over the W = 2 s window ending at the conflict tick (contact tick if any). On that: all runs with window-max <= 1000 ms complete (N<=24, N=31 s2/s3), at 1200 ms s5 completes and s1/s4 fail -> tau(overtake) = 1.0 s, onset 1.2 s. W must be grounded in the planner (overtake commit gate / stage-hold-commit-pass timing); W = 1 and 3 s sensitivity requested; the same window definition needed for the accel scenario. Columns realized_age_maneuver_ms / network_age_maneuver_ms to be landed. Paper, figure axis, checker switched. Smoke: worktree lacked the three pb2 stubs (gitignored; --build compiles only ecloud); copied; re-running. N=28 x5 queued after accel T12.
- Maneuver-window columns landed (realized_age_maneuver_ms, network_age_maneuver_ms; window ends at the first-contact tick or the conflict tick 236). W = 2 s is the planner's collision look-ahead (collision_time_ahead=2 -> CollisionChecker(time_ahead=2), behavior_agent.py:169; lookahead_interp projects the consumed forecast 2 s ahead, collision_check.py:245,643-644). tau(overtake) = 1.0 s, onset 1.2 s, invariant for W = 1/2/3 s (only the onset bin purity changes). Accel uses the same planner horizon; its conflict tick and window land with its T12 half. Paper §5.4 states the grounding and the sensitivity. Smoke: the idfix worktree lacked four untracked assets (pb2 stubs, WorldFusion+MTR model dirs, the sort submodule, plus a flock/CARLA fd-inheritance bug); fixed, import-tested, re-running; tag only after a cell reaches full runtime. Worktree provisioning checklist recorded by the eval session.
- FREEZE-1h = commit 71c9f37e (branch idfix-assoc; tag to be pushed). Smoke passed: warm_look4 CLEAN (single tid for cid 200, first_use > crossing 61>55/165>156/265>257, PUBGATE 28); warm_look1 collided (episodes 2; within the 9/10 baseline; mechanics correct); reactive clean; accel_warm clean with HANDOFFROW 1, AGEROW 598, COASTROW 32 (regenerated runner current); burst_warm CLEAN with all 6 platoon members warm_before_first_use (forwarding NOT needed); burst_cold collided (negative control). Runners flow/accel/burst at 71c9f37e, 0-diff, five markers. Campaign signed off and launched: Atlas A 6x20 -> B 6x20 (look2/3/4, computed, mtr, oracle; 1 s row = A's warm) -> E theta x5 -> faults x fencing -> netem; cetus accel T12 x5 -> N=28 x5 -> 5.3 matrix 6x10 x3 cells -> Table 8 -> T19b. Paper §4.2 states the identity merge, projected gate, and replace-on-final-update.
- 1h campaign live: Atlas frozen_batch_1h.sh (flock) in idfix_wt @ 71c9f37e: A 6x20 -> B 6x20 -> E theta x5, landing frozen1h_rows.csv per block; faults x fencing + netem chained after E. Cetus cetus_t12_accel_1h.sh (flock, HEAD guard): accel T12 7x5 (t12_lut_1h_accel) -> flow N=28 x5 -> 5.3 matrix -> Table 8 -> T19b. Tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1h pushed to origin (origin moved to git@github.com:tlandle/eCAV.git; sandbox remote URL updated). Block ETAs after hl_warm_r1.
- 1h ETAs (measured 3.4 min/run on Atlas incl. CARLA restart; ~4 min on cetus): Atlas A 120 runs -> ~22:50 Sep 6; B 120 -> ~05:40 Sep 7; E 25 -> ~07:00 Sep 7; faults+netem after (config being finalized). Cetus: accel T12 35 -> ~18:30 Sep 6; N=28 flow x5 ~0.3 h; 5.3 matrix 180 ~12 h; Table 8 60 ~4 h; T19b 100 ~7 h (estimates firm up after the first accel run). hl_warm_r1 clean.
- Sep 6 16:23 status: Atlas 1h block A running (5 of 120 done; first rep: warm/reactive/handover_snapshot clean, kf/edgewarp collided). Cetus accel T12 chain BROKEN: all 20 logs are one line, 'cetus_t12_accel_1h.sh: line 26: NS3_LUT_N=16: command not found' (env assignment executed as a command); no run started, no ecav process, no tmux session; ~30 min lost. Ordered: fix, run one accel cell by hand with its config row and marker counts before relaunching (the first-run sign-off was skipped here), then relaunch from accel T12.
- Cetus fixed and relaunched (~+40 min): root cause `( "$@" VAR=x cmd )` without `env` (words from $@ are not parsed as assignments); Atlas used `env "$@"`. Hand-run accel cell signed off: openscenario_1_accel_gt @ 71c9f37e, NS3_LUT_N=4, warm/predictive/1 s, 12/300; RUNROW 1, AGEROW 227, HANDOFFROW 1, COASTROW 16; lut_n=4 applied end to end. WATCH ITEM: that accel warm run at N=4 COLLIDED (episodes 2, contact ticks 21; realized age 400 ms); the smoke's accel_warm was clean (n=2: 1/1). If accel warm collides at the lightest load across seeds, the accel limit is below the pipeline floor (~300 ms) and tau(accel) is a bound in the other direction: a finding about cadence vs maneuvering actors, not about radio load. Lesson recorded: smoke validated runners, not batch scripts' env passing; one hand cell per new batch script before any chain.
- Cetus healthy (16:35 relaunch; t12_ac_n4_s1 real: RUNROW 1, AGEROW 242, HANDOFFROW 1). Cetus ETAs at ~5 min/run: accel T12 -> ~19:30 Sep 6; N=28 flow ~0.4 h; 5.3 matrix ~15 h; Table 8 ~5 h; T19b (125) ~10 h. Process hazard fixed: inline ssh 'pkill -f cetus...' self-matched the ssh session; kill/clean/launch now in a named remote script (cetus_relaunch.sh).
- Sep 6 17:06: Atlas block A 17/120 (warm 2/3, reactive 2/3, handover_snapshot 1/3, kf 0/3, edgewarp 0/3, cold 0/2). ALARM: accel T12 on cetus: warm 0/5 clean at N=4 and 0/4 at N=8 with p95 age 400-600 ms: Khonsu fails every acceleration run at the lightest load (pre-freeze accel had warm 3/4 clean). Either the accel limit is below the pipeline floor (cadence finding) or the regenerated accel runner (flow-derived) is not running the old accel scenario (constants like MAX_STEP/ego speed/ONCOMING_ACCEL profile). Ordered: pause the accel sweep; contact actor/tick evidence for the 9 collided runs; diff regenerated vs old accel runner's effective scenario; controls on cetus (accel cold N=4 x2; accel warm N=4 x2 on the OLD runner from develop@2e5ea710).
- Accel diagnosis (eval session): scenario config unchanged (Scenario_1, num_actors=2, scenario_1_accel.xml; Tesla oncoming at x=210, carlacola truck at x=278); the old runner docstring was stale. LIKELY CAUSE: ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 was never set by the accel T12 batch (nor runner nor YAML), so every 'accel' run so far is a constant-velocity 2-actor overtake; the pre-freeze warm 3/4 vs kf 0/4 result requires maneuvering, so the old batch harness must have set it. Forensics on collided runs: migration works (prepare 85, crossing 86), ego travels ~93 m, contact with the Tesla at tick ~164 with 'Broadcasting 0 predictions' at the collision tick. Writing-session concern: Khonsu 9/9 collided with ONE constant-velocity oncoming is suspicious in itself (flow 9/10, FLOW_N=2 5/5); ordered a per-tick trace of cid 199 at the destination from commit to contact (alive/publishable/published/ego cache), checking whether the identity merge dropped the live track or the track aged out after commit. Controls: regen cold N=4 x2, old-runner warm N=4 x2 (both without ONCOMING_ACCEL), plus regen warm N=4 x2 WITH ONCOMING_ACCEL=1. ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 now part of the accel config row.
- cid 199 trace (accel n4 s1, commit 86 -> contact ~164): one tid ever (tid 1, 158 tracker lines), alive at contact (act=True, tsu=3), coasting correctly (|v| 11.91), MTR predicting it; the identity merge never fired; the fix is CLEARED and block A is trusted. edge_preds_received_total=0 is an accounting artifact (same 0 in clean flow runs). The accel 9/9 is a separate scenario issue: the 2-actor geometry (Tesla x=210, truck x=278) collides at constant velocity under the current constants and ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 was never set. Ordered: recover the pre-freeze accel batch's full env (q4_accel_redo / khonsu_design_sweep.sh accel entries) and diff against the T12 accel env; resume only when control 3 (ONCOMING_ACCEL=1) or a reproduced-env warm cell is clean. Accel sweep and accel 5.3 arms paused.
- ACCEL 9/9 EXPLAINED BY THE KB (August 'REMAINING BLOCKER', ~line 2912): in the single-oncoming scenario the ego's overtake commit (truck + ov_wait timer) fires BEFORE the oncoming's handoff into the ego's locale (dr_warm: commit 110, handoff 143); the ego's locale has no track -> GO -> stall -> hit. Pre-freeze warm 3/4 relied on the pre-commit publish leak closed in 1g; with the gate the ego is blind to source-owned actors until commit; the 8-vehicle flow masks it. Conclusion: FORWARDING is required (the destination forwards the source's forecast for a prepared track under epoch e until commit; §3.5's epoch rule presumes it). Ordered: confirm on two collided accel runs (commit tick vs handoff tick; ego cache at commit), then implement in shared edge code, smoke (accel warm with ONCOMING_ACCEL=1, accel cold, burst warm/cold, flow look1/look4, reactive), tag freeze-1i, restart block A on 1i. The earlier reverted §3.4 forwarding sentence will be restored once confirmed.
- FORWARDING HYPOTHESIS REFUTED (t12_ac_n4_s1, wall-clock aligned): Tesla commit to locale_0 at 16:36:51 (tick 86), destination first use tick 109; ego do_ov commit at 16:37:02 (x=307.7, inside locale_0, ov_wait=0); first collision 16:37:18. The ego held the committed forecast ~11 s before committing and collided 16 s later: a forecast-content or decision problem, not blindness. Forwarding withdrawn; nothing built. Ordered trace: consumed forecast (position/speed/TTC) vs GT at the ego commit and per edge cycle to contact; whether the gate consulted it; the track's velocity estimate over the window (clue: collision_check obs_spd 3.4 m/s vs COASTROW |v| 11.91, true 12); suspect: the identity merge adopting a fresh native pose with a one-frame velocity near zero. Block A continues (trusted). Controls still finishing.
- Accel controls (N=4, identical env, no ONCOMING_ACCEL): regen cold 2/2 collided; OLD runner (2e5ea710) warm 2/2 CLEAN; regen warm 0/5 collided; control3 pending. The pre-freeze redo_accel.sh also never set ONCOMING_ACCEL, so the accel discriminator is migration timing, not maneuvering. Content trace: velocity-reset refuted (coast |v| flat 11.91; obs_spd 3.4 was post-collision); blind-commit refuted; REAL SIGNAL: EGO-DBG ttc=1000, hazard False from the ego commit to near-contact and no TRAJ_COLL before commit: the ego's collision_check never receives the oncoming trajectory although the edge holds the correct track -> forecast DELIVERY into collision_check fails in the single-oncoming case; the 8-vehicle flow masks it ('GT injection within 50 m keeps one in range'). Ordered: (1) verify on block-A hl_warm/hl_cold runs that TRAJ_COLL fires from EDGE-delivered trajectories and state exactly what GT injection injects (identity vs trajectory) and its range; stop block A if the gate is fed by injected GT; (2) clarify whether the old-runner control ran the old runner on the 1h stack or the whole old tree; (3) trace edge broadcast -> ego cache -> collision_check for cid 199 and name the dropping filter; bisect if needed. No code changes yet.
- METHODOLOGY FACT (yamls at 1h, all Khonsu scenarios incl. corridor): gt_detection_injection {enabled: true, max_range_m: 50, exclude_managed: true, occlusion_check: true}: the edge's fusion output is replaced by simulator actor poses within 50 m of the edge and not occluded from it; the WorldFusion model still runs each cycle (compute and payload real). The paper did not state it; §5.1 now discloses it as a perception oracle within 50 m with the fusion model executed for latency (Tyler to confirm wording). Relevance to the accel trace: with occlusion_check the destination never natively detects the Tesla behind the truck; its only source is the migrated track, so if the publish path requires a native/recent observation, predictions are never broadcast ('Broadcasting 0 predictions'); the 8-vehicle flow masks it. Asked the eval session to check that requirement.
- BLOCK A STANDS: GT injection is detection-POSE replacement (identity + position) within 50 m, model still run; the tracker and predictor compute the forecast; it is arm-independent, and hl_cold_r1 collides (HANDOFFROW 0, TRAJ_COLL 29) while hl_warm is 9/10 with identical injection, so the gate is fed by the edge/migrated forecast, not GT. Old-runner control ran the WHOLE 2e5ea710 tree (does not isolate runner vs stack); control 4 = 2e5ea710 runner .py on the 1h stack, one warm single-oncoming run: clean -> regenerated-runner regression (flow constant unfit for one oncoming); collides -> shared-stack regression -> bisect. Then the delivery-gap trace (broadcast -> cache -> collision_check) to name the filter dropping the single migrated oncoming. control3 pending. Accel and cetus tail paused; block A continues.
- Accel trace refined: the edge emits forecasts for the occluded migrated track (31 MTR predictions before the ego commit; commit refresh 16:36:51, ego commit 16:37:02) so emission/delivery timing is not the gap; ttc=1000 all the way -> CONTENT or CONSUMPTION. Clue: early predicted positions read x=210 (import anchor) while the coast advances to 246+. Hypothesis sent: the predictor consumes the memo bank (observed poses) that never refreshes for an occluded migrated track, so the forecast stays anchored at the import pose; COASTROW projection serves association only; the 8-vehicle flow masks it (vehicles within 50 m refresh). Check ordered: MTR IN world_past vs COASTROW vs GT at the ego commit and two earlier cycles. §5.1 disclosure wording tightened (unmanaged, unoccluded, 50 m; migrated actors served by the edge forecast). Control 4 (old runner .py on the 1h stack) queued behind control 3.
- Control 3: regen warm + ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 = 0/2 (collided). Control table: regen cold 0/2, regen warm 0/5, regen warm+ACCEL 0/2, old tree (2e5ea710) warm 2/2 clean; control 4 (old runner .py on the 1h stack) pending. The regression is in code between 2e5ea710 and freeze-1h; ONCOMING_ACCEL is not the fix.
- Anchored-history hypothesis REFUTED by numbers: MTR IN world_past advances with the coast (tail 248.5 -> 255.7 == COASTROW 248.52 -> 255.67); at the ego commit the forecast is correct (oncoming x~256-260 closing at 11.91 m/s, ego x=307.7, ~2.2 s to close) yet EGO-DBG ttc=1000, hazard False, do_ov=True. Defect = the EGO's collision_check / overtake gate not consuming the available oncoming forecast in the single-oncoming case (flow: TRAJ_COLL fires, hazard True). Ordered for the gate trace after control 4: what collection the gate iterates (merged predictions vs local perception objects; with occlusion the ego's own perception has no oncoming) and whether a lane/heading filter excludes the Tesla (y 199.2 vs ego 195.2) before pull-out. Three writing-session hypotheses refuted today (forwarding, velocity reset, anchored history); the localizer decides.
- Gate trace (behavior_agent.py): the overtake gate calls _nearest_oncoming_ahead (line 2189 -> def 1092) over generated_predictions (merged edge cache + local; lines 357-383), not local objects; filters (1133-1157: ahead>0.5, 1<|lateral|<9, speed>=3, opposing) pass the Tesla at commit (ahead 51.7, lateral 4.0, 11.91 m/s). Since need = 4*(7+onc) ~ 75.6 > clear 51.7 would WAIT, the GO means cid 199 was ABSENT from generated_predictions at commit: a delivery gap edge broadcast -> ego cache. 'Broadcasting 0 predictions' on 531/704 cycles points at the EDGE-side broadcast filter (risk-budget gating, ROI, publishable check, k_cav) rather than the ego cache. Ordered: DEBUG run with [OT SIGHT]/[OT PREDS] plus edge-side per-track broadcast/exclusion logging; confirm no AOI_INJECT_MS in the batch env. Control 4 still running.
- ACCEL ROOT CAUSE NAMED (eval session, code + logs): behavior_agent.py:1140 the overtake gate reads obs.kf_speed_mps (track_utils.py:107-119, the tracker KF velocity estimate), and line 1147 skips tracks with speed < 3.0 (moving-only filter). For the occluded single oncoming the destination never gets a native detection (occlusion_check), so the KF estimate ramps from 0 (0.00 -> 0.71 -> 1.93 -> 3.49 -> 6.49 over ~30 ticks) while the migrated velocity is a correct 11.91; the gate treats the oncoming as stationary clutter, returns inf, GO, collision. Flow masks it (unoccluded oncoming within 50 m converge the KF). Control 4 inconclusive (old runner crashes on the new stack, API drift); the filter is stack-side; old tree clean 2/2. FIX APPROVED (design, §3.3/§4.2 velocity in the record): imported/coasting tracks publish the migrated velocity until k native updates; [VELSRC] log; speed<3 filter kept. Block A finishes on 1h (pre-fix reference, superseded); smoke (accel warm x2 clean, accel cold collide, flow look1/look4, burst warm/cold; gate onc_spd == migrated velocity); tag freeze-1i; restart Atlas A -> B -> E -> faults -> netem and the cetus chain on 1i (~14 h for A+B). Tyler notified.
- DEBUG evidence locks the cause: [OT PREDS] shows cid 199 IN the ego's generated_predictions (delivery fine; my cache-absence inference was wrong), [OT SIGHT] oncoming_ahead=inf onc_spd=2.0 need=36 m -> GO: _nearest_oncoming_ahead rejects the Tesla because obs.kf_speed_mps < 3.0 (un-converged KF estimate for the occluded migrated track). Fix being implemented with diff-before-run: imported/coasting tracks publish the migrated velocity until >= k native updates (k from the tracker's convergence count, read not guessed) or the KF speed exceeds it; speed<3 filter unchanged; [VELSRC] log. Block A finishes and lands on 1h first.
- CORRECTION (eval session DEBUG): the kf_speed-from-migrated fix ALREADY EXISTS at 1h (wrapper.py:183-189, commit cb9888f4); [OT PREDS] cid 199 carries spd 11.9. The real defect: the overtake sight check ran only TWICE at maneuver start (npreds 2-3), returned inf both times (onc_spd floored to 2.0, need 36 m -> GO), and do_ov LATCHED for 49 ticks with no re-check as the oncoming appeared. Candidates: (a) cid 199 not yet in generated_predictions at the two evals + latch; (b) empty predicted_trajectory skipping the pred (line 1121); (c) a geometry filter at those ticks. A cid=-1 sibling track at (260.8,198.8) spd 12.2 exists beside cid 199 (native detection without id; position-gate fallback did not merge at 7.4 m). Diagnostic ordered (skip reasons per pred per sight-eval, latch re-check, first-appearance tick, sibling source). Fix will be planner-side (re-evaluate while latched) or timing, applies to all arms, smoke on flow/burst before any tag. Block A is 28/120 (~5 h), not minutes.
- ACCEL ROOT CAUSE PINNED ([ONCDBG], behavior-preserving diagnostic on cetus, reverted): cid 199 traj_len 100, ahead 55 m, speed 11.91, adv -0.16 (opposing) but |lateral| = 0.6 < 1.0 -> REJECT=geom by the band 1.0 < |lateral| < 9.0 (behavior_agent.py:1133), which drops a head-on oncoming that has aligned with the ego. Timing: the first [OT SIGHT] eval precedes cid 199's first appearance in generated_predictions (ego-side delivery lag after the edge commit at tick 86) -> GO; the second eval rejects it on lateral; do_ov latched 255 ticks with 2 evals. cid=-1 sibling = native fusion detection without id at 7.4 m (merge keys on id; 8 m gate borderline) -> T10 item. FIX APPROVED: (1) for opposing tracks drop the lateral lower bound (keep it for non-opposing); (2) re-evaluate the sight check every tick while latched, hold/abort on an opposing track inside the required clearance, [OT RECHECK] log. Planner defects applying to all arms. Smoke on cetus while block A runs on Atlas (accel warm x3 clean, accel cold x2 collide, flow warm look1 x2, reactive, cold, burst warm/cold), then freeze-1i, stop A on 1h, restart both chains on 1i.
- Tyler: the microbench post-handoff displacement (0.2-0.3 m one-frame; 2.8-9.3x) is small in absolute terms. Decision: §5.2 leads with post-handoff forecast error at the planner's horizon (T9: minADE@3 s, minFDE@5 s, miss@2 m for migrated tracks over the first five refreshes after commit, per arm), the displacement table stays as detail with absolutes stated, and the intro's 2.8-9.3 line is replaced by the closed-loop outcome. T9 moved to the top of the eval CPU queue on the finished 1h block-A logs (frozen1h_posthandoff_pred.csv).
- Paper: the 2.8-9.3x displacement ratio removed from the abstract, intro, motivation, conclusion, and §5.2 opener; the state-required result now leads with the closed-loop outcome (history arms 8-9/10, snapshot arms 0-1/10) and a T9 placeholder for horizon forecast error; the microbench stays as tracker-isolation detail with absolutes (centimetres vs 0.2-0.3 m).
- Planner fix implemented on branch fix-oncoming-gate (8d5bf1f6, behavior_agent.py only): (1) opposing tracks (adv<0) use |lateral| < 9 (lower bound lifted), non-opposing unchanged; (2) per-tick recheck while do_overtake latched: need = 4*(7+max(onc,2)); clear < need -> HOLD via the RSS proper-response brake (_committed_brake_ttl >= 20), [OT RECHECK] HOLD/CLEAR per tick. Smoke on cetus (11 arms: accel warm x3/cold x2 with ONCOMING_ACCEL=1, flow warm look1 x2, reactive, cold, burst warm/cold), assertion: latched overtake must log a recheck. Writing-session reading rule sent: if accel warm still collides with HOLDs present, braking in the oncoming lane is a stall, and the recheck must abort to lane (not yet past the truck) or complete the pass; log ego x relative to the truck on each recheck. T9 runs on CPU in parallel.
- Tyler: report FDE. T9 lead column = minFDE@5 s (then minADE@3 s, miss@2 m), per arm with CIs; the replay microbench gets FDE@5 s / ADE@3 s columns for cold, one-frame, history over the four maneuvers (microbench_fde.csv) so §5.2's two tables share the unit. Decision tie: the overtake gate needs ~76 m clearance at 12 m/s, so metres of FDE at 5 s flip wait into go.
- T9 BLOCKER: the [EVAL] future-prediction logging samples only +0.25/+0.50/+1.25 s (edge_manager line 2221, horizons=[5,10,25] steps), so FDE@5 s / ADE@3 s cannot be computed from any existing log (1h included); extrapolating from +1.25 s would re-measure the input. Fix bundled into freeze-1i: horizons=[5,10,25,60,100] (+3 s, +5 s; the predicted trajectory is 100 points = 5 s), GT position logged alongside, arm and eval_tag in the line; the replay microbench emits the same horizons. T9 and microbench_fde land from 1i. Answer to Tyler's 'why isn't FDE in the paper': the horizon was never logged.
- freeze-1i candidate = ab5bab5a (branch fix-oncoming-gate off 71c9f37e): behavior_agent.py (opposing lateral bound lifted; recheck-while-latched with hold + subj_ahead) and edge_manager [EVAL] horizons [5,10,25,60,100] with tick/arm/tag stamped; FDE@5 s joins predicted@T with the actor's Actual line at T+100 (GT not loggable at prediction time). Microbench replay emits the same horizons. Smoke on cetus (~40 min); on pass: tag + push 1i, config rows, stop block A on 1h, restart both chains.
- Planner-fix smoke (partial): DETECTION works ([OT RECHECK] fires every latched tick; HOLD with clear 40 < need 91, onc_spd 15.7; the gate now sees the head-on oncoming) but the RESPONSE fails: at the first HOLD subj_ahead=18.8 m (not cleared) and the brake ttl I set is overridden by the overtake-continuation path (brake_ttl=0, 10.9-11.1 m/s), so the ego drives through; accel warm r1/r2 still collide (episodes 1). NOT tagged (the collision moved failure modes). Ordered: abort-to-lane when clear < need and subj_ahead > 0 (do_overtake False, return-to-lane path, [OT RECHECK] ABORT), COMPLETE when subj_ahead < 0, 10-tick hysteresis before re-commit; re-smoke; tag only on accel warm 3/3 zero-contact with completion reported, cold colliding, flow/burst at pattern.
- Abort-to-lane implemented (1i candidate bd8d9133): clear<need & subj_ahead>=0 -> ABORT (do_overtake False, counter cancelled, return-to-lane); subj_ahead<0 -> COMPLETE; re-commit blocked until 10 consecutive clear ticks; [OT RECHECK] ABORT/COMPLETE/CLEAR/RECOMMIT-OK. Detection-only smoke had reached only 4/11 cells (accel warm 3/3 collided, accel cold running); flow/burst folded into the abort re-smoke (11 arms, ~55 min). Another ssh pkill self-match killed a session; kill+relaunch moved into a named remote script. Tag criteria unchanged; completion reported alongside contact.
- Jordan (message to Tyler, Sep 6): has unpushed planner fixes from Friday: (1) separate TTC for own-lane collision (stopped 'ambulance'/truck ahead) vs other-lane (oncoming during overtake): the ego conflated them, decided to overtake, saw the oncoming, could not, and kept creeping into the stopped vehicle (the same failure we pinned today); (2) removed the curved-road suppression (local_planner_behavior.py potential_curved_road gating) which caused false collision warnings on merges. Not in the repo (no commits by Jordan since June; branches distributed-integration / ecav_2_distributed are old). Our planner changes this week: 050ce4bb (Aug 9) overtake gate _nearest_oncoming_ahead; b7d5a143 (Aug 11) ego holds edge predictions across broadcast gaps; 8976a592/d4f592e6 (Sep 5) T12 AOI knob + AOIROW; bd8d9133 (fix-oncoming-gate) opposing lateral bound + recheck/abort + EVAL horizons. Decision for Tyler: fold Jordan's fix into 1i (hold tag; merge; re-smoke) or tag now and fold into freeze-2. Eval session told to hold the tag.
- Jordan's third item CONFIRMED on develop and NOT fixed by us: edge_manager_prediction_late_fusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor._advance_actors (line 1152) loops over vehicle managers only; the docstring says 'each RSU updates and runs its step' but there is no RSU loop, so a late-fusion edge's tracker gets no RSU input (edge 0 tracks nothing; scenario can 'pass' while not working). Last touch 1f970053 (Jul 8, Tyler). Khonsu runs are unaffected: the WorldFusion manager updates RSUs every step in apply_predictions (lines 955-957: rsu.update_info(); rsu.run_step()), and late fusion is ablation-only. Jordan's fix to land with his other two.
- Jordan's branch origin/jordan-behavior-fixes (f012239c, 4f7b5150, 7adcdd81; Aug 22): (1) overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead (default 2.0 s) for adjacent_check=True collision checks instead of collision_time_ahead; (2) potential_curved_road removed from the step-8 overtake guard (latches on merge geometry, forces car-following, traced by Jordan to creep-into-obstacle collisions); (3) RSU update loop restored in late-fusion _advance_actors. Test-merge onto fix-oncoming-gate: 0 conflicts. Ordered: merge into fix-oncoming-gate, confirm collision_time_ahead (2) and record both thresholds in the config row, rerun the 11-arm smoke on the merged planner (flow/burst may shift; ordering + accel criteria must hold), tag freeze-1i on the merge commit, restart both chains.
- Jordan's big open item (via Tyler): one-time handoff too early -> the migrated track drifts -> the destination's first native detection cannot associate (his 2 m tolerance) -> the handed-off track is discarded. Same mechanism as our 4 s lead collapse (18 m drift, 8 m gate, duplicate track). Framework answer since 1b/1h: final update at commit (replaces the prepared record), projected coast (record pose + velocity x elapsed, re-anchored), identity merge with projected-pose position gate fallback, 2.5 s lead cap. STILL OPEN: the drift magnitude (18 m / 4 s on a 12 m/s actor = 4.5 m/s velocity error) is unexplained; COASTROW now logs vel_mps/spf/steps; asked for per-handoff migrated velocity vs true speed and residual drift at commit on the 1h look2/3/4 runs; if the velocity or scaling is wrong it goes into 1i before the tag (defeats the no-ID position gate otherwise).
- Merge done: a823e541 on fix-oncoming-gate (Jordan's three commits intact, zero conflicts; collision_time_ahead=2 == Jordan's overtake_lane_safety default 2.0, both recorded in the config row). The merge pulled older KB data files (pre-correction t12 CSVs etc.) into the branch; corrected CSVs were uncommitted on develop. POLICY set: freeze tags are code-only from 1i on (follow-up commit reverts data files on the merge before tagging); corrected data committed on develop as its own commit; paper data = docs/kb/data on develop, code = tags, eval_tag per row.
- DRIFT RESOLVED (1h COASTROW): migrated vel_mps=(11.91,0.01), |v| 11.91 vs true 12 (0.09 m/s error); spf 0.199 (0.2 s stride), steps 1,2,3...; projection advances 2.37 m/step = 11.9 m/s; residual drift ~0.18 m over 2 s, ~0.36 m over 4 s. The 18 m was pre-cb9888f4: the coast's frame-to-frame EMA restarted at zero on import, so a migrated occluded track read as ~stationary and fell behind the actor; cb9888f4 (migrated velocity in the coast) fixed it. No record/coast bug in the 1i candidate; proj-vs-GT at the crossing to be confirmed on look4 when block B runs. Eval session executing: code-only 1i candidate (revert data files on the merge), commit corrected data on develop, README note.
- freeze-1i CODE-ONLY candidate = 8f736384 on fix-oncoming-gate (merge a823e541 + revert of data files; diff vs 1h is code only: behavior_agent, WorldFusion edge_manager EVAL horizons, late-fusion RSU loop, shape check). Data committed on develop 2c327fdd (corrected T12 collided flags, maneuver-age columns, README provenance note). Config rows will record collision_time_ahead=2 and overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead=2.0. Sequence: abort-only smoke table (data) -> merged 11-arm smoke -> on pass tag+push 1i with Jordan's hashes -> stop block A on 1h -> restart both chains.
- Tyler: make sure our stuff works. Ordered an executable acceptance gate (scripts/khonsu_accept.py) run on every smoke cell before any tag: PASS/FAIL per invariant from existing log lines: runner signature incl. EVAL horizons; geometry env (12/300, ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 for accel); ownership (zero double-publishable ticks); publish gate (first destination publish > commit per track); final update per migrated track before first use (warm/edgewarp); single tid per migrated carla_id; coast |v| within 0.5 m/s and projected pose within 1 m of GT at the crossing; planner recheck every latched tick with no HOLD/ABORT while subj_ahead > 0 and still moving forward; migrated velocity as the published speed until k native updates; outcome criteria. Tag requires all PASS on all eleven cells; output as a table.
- Sep 6 19:11: Atlas running block A on 1h (46/120, superseded) ; cetus abort-only smoke 7/11 cells done. Campaign on 1i NOT running (waits on the merged smoke + acceptance gate + tag). Ordered: stop block A on 1h now, land its rows as the pre-fix reference, split the merged eleven-arm smoke across both GPUs, run the acceptance gate, tag, launch both chains.
- Tyler (Sep 6 19:20): data needed by tomorrow. Cetus reordered for early whole figures: accel T12 -> bo T12 rerun -> N=28 -> Table 8 (burst+density) -> matrix seeds 1-5 -> T19b seeds 1-3 -> matrix seeds 6-10 -> T19b seeds 4-5; each pass landed as it completes (same tag, figures update on the second pass). Atlas: A -> B -> E -> faults -> netem. Tag is the critical path.
- HARD DEADLINE: Tyler presents Mon Sep 7 11:00; data needed tonight. Reorder: Atlas 1i A seeds 1-10 (land) -> B seeds 1-10 (land) -> E -> A 11-20 -> B 11-20 -> faults -> netem. Cetus 1i: accel T12 -> Table 8 -> N=28 -> bo T12 rerun -> matrix seeds 1-5 -> T19b seeds 1-3 -> second passes. bo freshness from 1f stays in the paper until its rerun lands. Writing session rebuilds the deck and paper from landings overnight; deck to gtvault by ~07:00.
- Abort-only smoke: accel warm 0/3 (ABORT 1, RECOMMIT 1 each: the ego aborts, waits 10 clear ticks during the oncoming's 5 m/s cruise phase, re-commits, and the actor floors to 16 m/s into it); accel cold collides (baseline); flow warm look1 2/2 clean with one abort-recommit. Abort alone is defeated by the slow-then-fast profile. Merged smoke (with Jordan's lane-safety TTC) is the real test. Block A on 1h stopped at 47/120 and landed. DECISION: if accel still fails on the merge but everything else passes, tag 1i and launch the constant-velocity blocks tonight (Atlas A/B/E/faults/netem; cetus Table 8, N=28, bo rerun, flow_visible); accel T12 and the maneuvering cells wait for freeze-1j with a forecast-based re-commit (predicted arrival of the opposing track at the pass zone vs time to complete the pass).
- Deck rebuilt for the Mon 11:00 presentation (khonsu_story v6 builder): measured figures substitute the expected-shape toys when the paper pipeline has produced them (real_envelope from fig_envelope, real_trigger from fig_lead_cdf, real_density from fig_density; pdftoppm; 'MEASURED, tag' banner; pill Done); RQ2 slide rewritten on the freeze-1g constant-velocity flow result (pre-freeze 4-seed accel result withdrawn); mechanism slide adds shadow gate, final update replaces, identity merge; 'RQ3 evidence so far' rewritten (six defects fixed; 1g trigger ladder; bo freshness limit 1.0 s; density); status table rows updated; envelope slide experiment text now ns-3 load. Committed to scale_out_nsdi slides/; gtvault push refused 423 Locked (Tyler has the file open); retry on his word.
- Deck review (Tyler-forwarded, Sep 6 evening) applied: talk-spine slide (Conductor one locale -> many locales -> state discontinuity -> Khonsu -> corridor); slide 5 architecture only, slide 6 failure mode only ('Partitioning creates a state discontinuity'); RQ2 title 'A snapshot is insufficient for the overtake scenario'; freshness slide wording 'Current measurement: load-induced age sweep. Needed: controlled age-injection sweep per scenario'; 'We compare seven ways to maintain continuity' grouped (none / reactive / brute-force / Khonsu / oracle); closing footer 'The missing evidence is not whether the idea is plausible...'. 22 slides; pushed to gtvault (verified) and committed to slides/.
- Reviewer pass on the deck/contribution hierarchy (Tyler-forwarded, Sep 6 evening): strongest paper = scale-out creates a continuity problem that partitioning/overlap/migration do not solve cleanly; Khonsu preserves the state the planner needs, when it needs it, without continuously duplicating the service. Four contributions for the professor deck (multi-locale CP; temporal-state continuity; Khonsu; evaluation across alternatives and repeated handoffs). Biggest vulnerability: confounded baselines (EdgeWarp carries a snapshot) -> factorial design (T23: Experiment A state at fixed timing, Experiment B timing at full state) added to tonight's 1i campaign. Overlap as a first-class test (three proposals + replication as a cost question), alternatives matrix (state adequate / early enough / selective / one owner), capstone figure (cost vs warm-and-fresh). Deck: contributions slide, matrix slide, overlap table slide, factorial slide, capstone expected-shape slide added; T24 (conflict frequency near boundaries) added.
- Deck v6 (27 slides) pushed to gtvault (verified 925,474 B) and committed; KB baseline khonsu_story_2026-09-07.pptx. Factorial feasibility: band20/40 and the timing arms exist on 1i; Exp A one_frame/hist2/hist5 need MIGRATION_HIST -> history_depth wiring (~3 lines) and edgewarp_full a new mode (~5 lines). Decision (a): bundle the guarded, additive wiring into the 1i candidate before tagging (default path identical to the smoked code; diff shown; one hist2 and one edgewarp_full cell smoked before the factorial slot).
- Paper (scale_out_nsdi, Sep 6 evening): contributions restated per the reviewer (what breaks at scale-out incl. history-dependent tracking; Khonsu selective forecast-driven handoff; when alternatives suffice/fail and where Khonsu sits on safety vs cost, across repeated handoffs); §5.1 baselines framed on two axes (record at fixed trigger in §5.2, trigger at full record in §5.5); §5.6 gains the alternatives-by-requirement table (tab:alternatives). 15 pp, clean.
- Factorial wiring (guarded, additive, in fix_wt): pluggable base prepare path reads MIGRATION_HIST -> history_depth when _hd is None (kf/edgewarp/handover keep _hd=1; unset = full record = smoked path); runner final-sync set gains 'edgewarp_full' (EdgeWarp timing + full record). Config rows: one_frame/hist2/hist5 = warm timing + MIGRATION_HIST 1/2/5; edgewarp_full = predictive 1 s pre-copy + full record + final sync; band20/40 = warm + TRIGGER_MODE=band. Plan: amend 8f736384 with the diff on gate PASS, tag 1i, launch base; hist2 + edgewarp_full smoke on cetus before the factorial slot. Writing-session check sent: MIGRATION_HIST must also truncate the final update at commit, else Exp A measures only the pre-commit shadow.
- Field formats: v3 collided is YES/no, completed is YES/no (mixed case); aggregate case-insensitively.

## 2026-09-05 (writing session, 14:30): eval session idled overnight; Sep 5 plan restarted

- Freeze list progress (Sep 5): step 1 computed-trigger seeding fix landed on branch (EMA seeded from v3 median transfer 40 ms + first-fire floor; the 0.05 s guess was near-correct, so computed 5/10 vs fixed-1 s 7/10 in v3 is n=10 noise, not a seeding artifact; expect computed ~ fixed on the rerun). Step 2 T21 landed: per-locale accumulator, [COMPUTEROW] edge, locale, compute_s, veh_seconds, compute_per_veh_s at scenario end (feeds T14 compute column and T22). Step 3 T20 landed: TRIGGER_MODE=oracle fires L = fold-in + margin before the crossing using ground-truth CARLA velocity projected to the real boundary (same exit test as forecast/computed; removes prediction error only). Writing session flagged: equals the true crossing time only at constant speed; asked for true-crossing-time (scripted profile) before the freeze, else log as oracle_cv and the paper defines the oracle as true velocity with no prediction error. Step 4 T16 landed: arm matrix warm (predictive + full history, no resync), edgewarp (predicted-attachment pre-copy + snapshot + final delta sync at handover), handover_snapshot (at-crossing + snapshot; the old edgewarp arm), kf (predictive + snapshot), reactive (at-crossing + full history), cold; frozen batch harness now 7 arms. T20 resolution accepted: flow actors hold speed (WaypointFollower), so the velocity oracle is exact on the frozen trigger table; scripted-profile oracle for the corridor/accel at T13 build; rule applied as one commit per figure set (freeze-1 flow/burst/density/trigger/freshness; a second tag for the corridor). Writing session added to the frozen batch: the three non-headline cells of the §5.3 2x2 (acceleration, blind-overtake, occluded-maneuvering if a scenario exists) x 6 arms x 10 seeds (fallback 5), no new code. Steps 5-9 landed (Sep 5 evening). FREEZE-1: tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1 = commit 8976a592 (annotated tag object 9a1ff170; cite the commit in the paper). T15: MTR stashes all modes' world-frame endpoints + normalized probabilities; TRIGGER_MODE=mtr sums destination-locale mode probability, fires at > MTR_THETA (default 0.5, sweep 0.3-0.9); CV projection stays as TRIGGER_MODE=computed; smoke green (4 transfers, 3 HANDOFFROWs, zero errors). T12 knob AOI_INJECT_MS (planner-consumed forecast delayed d ms, no migration). t7-live-epochs merged. BOTH MACHINES RUNNING the tag: Atlas evaluation_outputs/frozen1 (~220 runs, ~17 h): headline 6 arms + handover_snapshot x10 on flow (visible/constant and occluded/constant), trigger sweep computed/mtr/oracle/look{2,3,4} x10, theta sweep x5, burst 3x5, density FLOW_N{2,4,8} x3 x5, §5.3 accel and flow-occluded cells 6 arms x5. Cetus evaluation_outputs/t12_tau (~120 runs, ~11 h): tau(u) for blind-overtake and accel x 12 delays (0-600 ms) x5. Then Atlas: faults+netem ~6 h, T19b ~8 h (Sep 5-8). T12 scenario gap: only blind-overtake and accel exist at freeze-1 (LTAP/SCP/stopped-lead unbuilt); the paper names it; extension to corridor conflict types under freeze-2. Writing-session decisions sent: 5.3 cells x5 accepted, seeds 6-10 on cetus after T12 if cross-machine rows are valid; asked whether any timing is wall-clock dependent and required a calibration cell (flow warm x5 on cetus vs Atlas) before pooling. T13 corridor build starts on a branch for freeze-2.
- Machine column is added at extraction (extractor --machine; log origin), not in frozen RUNROW code, to avoid a re-freeze; accepted. §5.3 gap surfaced by the eval session: the Atlas batch has only two non-headline cells (accel = visible/maneuvering, flow-occluded = occluded/constant) at x5; the occluded/maneuvering cell (flow + accel) was missing. Cetus chain after T12: seeds 6-10 for those two cells (60 runs) + occluded/maneuvering seeds 1-10 (60 runs), ~11 h, so all four 2x2 cells reach 10.
- Tyler's decision (Sep 5 evening): the paper states one accelerator, an NVIDIA A10, for all measurements, with the intent to replace the runs on an A10 later; no per-machine gating, cetus and Atlas rows pool, calibration cell dropped, §5.3 seeds 6-10 run on cetus after T12. Rows still carry a machine column for recoverability. Paper §5.1 hardware sentence replaced accordingly and the 16 GB capacity number removed from §2.1 and the Figure 1 caption (scale_out_nsdi 4eec133). Actual hardware for freeze-1 rows: Atlas RTX 4080 Super 16 GB, cetus RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB (KB only; not in the paper).
- Cross-machine validity (eval session, from frozen code): migration link modeled (link.py, never perf_counter); k_cav selection uses modeled cost constants and a sim-deterministic estimator; edge cadence 0.2 s and sim step 0.05 s are sim-time; age at use and AOI_INJECT are sim ticks. ONE wall-dependent path: the adaptive predictor's per-tick budget = 130 ms deadline - measured pre-prediction compute_ms (perf_counter), and with enable_risk_budget=true that budget gates which tracks get full MTR; a slower GPU can drop tracks from full prediction. Likely inert on the sparse flow scenario; must be measured. Calibration chained on cetus after T12: flow warm x5 on the frozen tag (evaluation_outputs/cetus_calib) vs Atlas hl_warm rows (collided-or-not, transfers, bytes, age at use). Pooling of cetus rows and the §5.3 seeds 6-10 on cetus are gated on it; if it fails, tau(u) is cetus-specific and every table states its machine. Paper §5.1 now states the hardware per table, simulation time, the wall-clock exception, and carries a calibration placeholder (scale_out_nsdi).
- Between Sep 4 23:35 and Sep 5 14:30 nothing moved: no commits on any branch, no runs on Atlas, cetus idle. The eval session does not continue between prompts; the orchestrating (writing) session must kick each block. Sent the ordered Sep 5 list with instructions to run it to the end and message at each landing: computed-trigger seeding fix, T21, T20, T16, T15 (smoke), T12 knob, merge t7-live-epochs, freeze tag khonsu-eval-freeze-1, then batch on Atlas and T12 on cetus against the frozen hash. If T15 is not clean tonight, freeze Sep 6.

## 2026-09-04 (writing session, morning): Q5 scale and provenance closure written in

- Correction: the eval chain did not stall; q5 and s5 ran overnight (my check fell between chain end and its verification). Q5 (q5_scale_rows.csv, n=5, N=2/4/8 oncoming): collision-free runs warm 5,2,4; handover snapshot 0,1,0; cold 0,0,1; ordering holds at every density; warm's N=4 dip is noise. Written into scale_out_nsdi §5.8 as tab:scale (collision-free runs only; completion field format at that commit still being confirmed by the eval session). Provenance closed: canonical warm arm at ecc4b092 reran 4/4 with zero collisions under the env contract; q4 table stays retired for the dead-trigger reason.
- T8 mini-landing written in (scale_out_nsdi 84143fd): serialized MigrationPayload measured at 1247 B over the real gRPC relay (t7-live branch), so the paper says 1.25 KB everywhere (intro, §2.4, tab:bytes, §5.2); §4.2 Transport now states the relay and clean-loopback timings (prepare 1.81 ms, commit 0.29 ms) with the netem matrix (delay 0/5/20/50 ms x loss 0/1/5%) as the remaining placeholder. Sudo: atlas already has NOPASSWD ALL; the only gate is the eval session's tool prompt. PDF is 14 pp only because one reference spills; body ends before the references.
- Figure completeness (Tyler: every figure must be producible from a run). Audit of the seven expected-shape figures vs tasks: faults T7, corridor T13, trigger front T15/s5/T18 covered; envelope (threshold rule), overlap (one speed, no compute metric), crossing load (no task), sizing (no task) not. Added to nsdi_push_tasks.md (cbaa79ca): T19 per-handoff timing rows with warm_before_first_use (prerequisite), T19b crossing-load sweep platoon {1,2,4,8,16} x 5 arms, T20 TRIGGER_MODE=oracle, T21 edge compute per vehicle-second, T14 amendment (20 m/s cells + compute), T12 amendment (tau(u) = largest delay with every seed clean; full curve reported), T22 sizing analysis. Paper eq:tau now states that rule (scale_out_nsdi 9b7c7dd). Deck: envelope toy figure redrawn on the rule, load and sizing slides marked Needed; pushed to gtvault and verified.
- Eval session on the figure audit (afternoon): T19 merges with T7-live as one instrumentation drop (epochs + LEADROW + XFERROW + HANDOFFROW), Sep 5; T20 oracle rides T16, Sep 5-6; T21 compute accumulator before the T15 batch, Sep 6; T12 rule adopted verbatim; T14 amendments folded, Sep 10-11; T22 Sep 12-13. T19b decision (writing session): four existing arms (Khonsu, mirror, handover snapshot, cold) on Sep 8, dual-service column added when T14 lands. s5: pinned-worktree replay abandoned after a fourth failure (missing perception_pb2; zombie rows purged from the v1 CSV); lookahead {2,3,4} x 10 now running on current develop with the contract env into the v3 logdir, so the trigger table is v3-internal on one code version (at-crossing, 1-4 s, computed after fix, MTR, oracle). GPU oversubscribed Sep 8-11; slip order if needed: T19b fifth arm, then T14 speed cells; corridor keeps priority.
- Run accounting (evaluation_outputs, RUNROW mtimes): 345 closed-loop runs since Aug 28 (v1 150, v2 75, v3 75, q5 45); per day Aug 28: 12, Aug 30: 21, Aug 31: 117, Sep 1-2: 0 (grind diagnosis), Sep 3: 167, Sep 4: 28. 225 discarded (v1/v2 unvalidated geometry), 120 usable. Throughput when running ~10 min/run on the one Atlas GPU. Rerun rule (Tyler) adopted by the eval session as ONE frozen eval commit: Sep 5 merge t7-live + T16 + T20 + T21 + computed-trigger fix, freeze; Sep 6-8 ~200-run batch (headline 6 arms, burst, q5 cells, lookahead 2-4 s, computed, MTR trigger with theta sweep, oracle, T17, T18); then fault arms x fencing, netem matrix, T19b four arms Sep 8-9; corridor smoke Sep 8-9. Consequence: tonight's lookahead rows and the banked v3/q5/burst rows become pilot data, superseded by the frozen set; final figures only from the frozen set. Writing session conditions sent: one freeze only; T12 (275 runs, ~45 h) not in the batch list, placement required or a second GPU is raised with Tyler.
- Freeze readiness (eval session, Sep 4 evening): T19 rows and T7/T8 instrumentation built on branch; computed-trigger fix, T16, T20, T21, and the T12 consume-side delay knob all go into the frozen commit Sep 5; the risk is T15 (MTR-mode trigger + theta), built and smoke-tested Sep 5 or the freeze slips to Sep 6 (batch Sep 7-9, corridor smoke ahead of the batch tail, T19b behind). T12 (275 runs, ~45-50 GPU h) does not fit on Atlas before Sep 12: with a second GPU by Sep 7 it lands Sep 9-10; on Atlas alone it starts Sep 10 and finishes ~Sep 12 on nights. Second-GPU requirements: CARLA 0.9.15, repo at the frozen commit, opencda310 env, ~50 GPU h; Azure is the fit (April ablations ran the full stack on the A10), PACE has no CARLA. Azure A10 (20.81.176.215) ssh timed out Sep 4; raised with Tyler.
- Second GPU resolved: Azure is out (eCloudSim, 2026Q1-6211, KishoreTeaching subscriptions all Disabled; only the CoC Education Lab is enabled, zero spend, NCSv3 quota only; the A10 edge-server cannot start). Tyler assigned his cetus workstation tlandle@143.215.184.49: RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB, 32 cores, 62 GB RAM, 408 GB free, CARLA 0.9.15 present, anaconda envs incl. opencda_py310, no repo, passwordless sudo, ssh works with the atlas key. Assigned to the eval session as the T12 host (clone at the frozen commit, env check, rsync checkpoints 5.9 GB, --build, smoke run, report peak GPU memory since 12 GB may be tight vs Atlas's 16 GB).
- Per-run wall time settled: 4.7 min median (p90 5.3) from v3 log mtimes, for 30 s of scenario time (600 synchronous ticks at ~260 ms wall each = 154 s) + fresh CARLA per run (~60-75 s) + model load (~50-70 s) + teardown. The 10 min figure (mine and the eval session's) was stale padding from the manual-run era. No safe cuts: RESTART_EVERY=1 stays (CARLA state bleed is a measured historical failure). Plan math: ~900 remaining runs = ~70 GPU h. Atlas: frozen batch 16 h + faults/netem 6 h + T19b 8 h + corridor ~3 h (6-7 min/run est., to be measured at smoke) = ~33 h over Sep 6-10. Cetus: T12 275 runs at ~5.5-6 min = ~26 h, Sep 7-9. Fits with margin for one rerun. Cetus bring-up: clone OK, opencda_py310 verified (torch 2.9.1+cu128), rsync in flight, smoke + peak VRAM pending.
- Cetus smoke 14 GREEN (Sep 4 23:34): full flow run on the 3080 Ti, RUNROW mode=warm trigger=predictive lookahead=1.00 episodes=0 contact_ticks=0 transfers=4 bytes=2488, 630 ticks, zero errors, ego eval dict present. Per-run wall 258 s scenario + 75 s CARLA settle = 5.5 min (Atlas 4.7). Peak VRAM 9,642 of 12,288 MiB. Bring-up needed 14 attempts (CUDA extensions rebuilt for sm_86 with a CUDA 12.8 toolkit in the cloned opencda310 env; ledger in the eval session's entry). Cetus logs: ~/ecloudsim_distributed_sandbox/evaluation_outputs/cetus_runs/ (latest.log symlink; RUN_WALL_S and PEAK_VRAM_MIB appended per log). Cetus idles until the frozen commit; T12 (275 runs, ~26 h) launches there against the frozen hash, Sep 7-9. Writing-session note: a pgrep -f pattern in a remote watch matches its own ssh shell; use the [b]racket trick.
- Eval ETAs (eval session): T16 Sep 5; T7-live fault arms Sep 5; T15 batch with T17/T18 Sep 6-7; T9 Sep 6; T12 Sep 8; T13 corridor build started, go/no-go Sep 9; T14 Sep 10-11; T10 after T13 smoke, at risk. T8 impaired runs need Tyler's sudo for netem. s5 lookahead redo third attempt running (worktree dependency checklist added).

## 2026-09-04 (writing session, night): sections 4-5 in Conductor form

- scale_out_nsdi d799afc (+ table sizing): §4 = 4.1 3D state-space tracking (K = 10 stated; same cadence in evaluation; MTR stateless; AB3DMOT baseline) and 4.2 cross-locale migration layer with Trigger / Import / State size / Transport paragraphs, a byte table (560 B history, ~680 B content, ~1.3 KB serialized, 448 B Kalman), constants with rationale, unit checks moved here, predictor-mode trigger stated with the CV runs flagged (T15). Old §4.3 platform and arms moved into §5.1 Methodology: platforms with section mapping, datasets with their uses, baselines defined once (handover snapshot renamed; faithful EdgeWarp arm pending T16; two named oracles: trigger oracle and single-instance oracle; overlap in three named forms), metrics standardized on Delta_use and success, constants table (activation radius label corrected per eval session; seeds policy 10 two-locale / 5 pilot). §5.2 state required (record ablation moved here; "lower-bounds" and "statistically indistinguishable" removed); §5.3 when continuity matters as a visibility x motion 2x2 with the v3 flow table as the visible/constant cell and the caveats; §5.4 freshness limit with tau(u) = max age with success probability >= 0.95; §5.5 trigger (warm-before-use vs wasted bytes; band described here; M and cap sensitivity); §5.6 alternatives incl. overlap width sweep; §5.7 corridor with four primary metrics and no 95% success criterion; §5.8 one scale axis (tracks per handoff window) + burst result + fault table + separate network sensitivity; §5.9 sizing with the concrete sweep. 13 pp, no undefined refs, no overfull.
- Eval session: K=10 confirmed; TRIGGER_DIST is a per-actor activation radius (ego to spawn), corrected in the table; T16/T17/T18 queued, with T17/T18 folded into the T15 CARLA batch (plan of record). Deck v6 with v3 results committed (scale_out_nsdi slides/, KB baseline); gtvault push refused 423 Locked again, Tyler's title-slide deletion ported.

## 2026-09-04 (eval session landing, relayed): v3 re-baseline on the corrected scenario

- docs/kb/data/relay_eval_2026_08/design_sweep_v3_rows.csv, 75/75 verified, zero crashes; binary metrics (completed-without-collision, collided from eps_raw). Flow (N=10/arm): observation history at crossing 9/10 clean; history 1 s ahead (Khonsu fixed lead) 7/10; Kalman snapshot 2/10; cold 2/10; EdgeWarp timing 0/10 (10/10 collided). Computed-lead arm 5/10, WITHHELD: transfer-time EMA seeds at 0.05 s before any handoff, so the first crossing's lead is a guess; fix folded into T15. Burst (N=5): history ahead 5/5 clean, EdgeWarp 0/5, cold 0/5. Grind resolved (env artifact); absolute-rate embargo lifted for v3-derived numbers only.
- Interpretation rule from the eval session: on this geometry the source sees the actor to the crossing, so at-crossing transfer suffices; do not claim warm > reactive here; the trigger table (lookahead redo + T15) adjudicates timing. Written into the paper (scale_out_nsdi: tab:flow in §5.3, burst sentence in §5.8, flow named as the "source can see" case in §5.5) and the deck status slides.
- Queue: q5 (running) -> s5 lookahead redo -> provenance reps -> T7-live + fault arms -> T9 -> T12 -> T15 -> T14; T13 corridor build started on a branch.

## 2026-09-04 (writing session, night): sections 2 and 3 restructured around scale-out

- Follow-up pass (4e717d4): §2.2 renamed Multi-locale deployment, §2.3 Traffic conflicts cannot be partitioned away; overlap caveat (overlap does not supply prior history); §2.4 opens with the simple-handoff alternative; §2.5 as four requirements (continuity, timeliness, ownership, failure handling); §3 compatibility model made consistent (shared record schema, compatible versions may differ, model state reused only on match, no translation across families); radio independence in three sentences; trigger prepares the highest-probability neighbor, counting each mode toward the first boundary crossed; predictor-context field marked unused; epoch resolution stated as publish-after-commit and prefer e+1 on concurrent forecasts; consistency demoted from a runtime contract to an evaluation criterion (freshness is the invariant). Two code items to the eval session: T15 predictor-mode trigger (the evaluated trigger today is the CV projection; the paper flags this in §4.2 with a red placeholder) and T10 association moved ahead of T11.

- scale_out_nsdi ea3cfef. §2 "Scaling Cooperative Prediction Across Locales": 2.1 geographic scaling limit (canvas measurement, cap specific to our stack, many instances required); 2.2 constructing a multi-locale deployment (locale definition, anchors, overlap, edge-server mapping, locale handoff, independence from radio cells); 2.3 conflicts and actors cross boundaries (placement contains fixed conflicts, not traffic-generated ones); 2.4 state required across locales (can a destination restart from a detection: Kalman vs history, forced-handoff 2.8-9.3x, temporal track state defined after the evidence); 2.5 requirements for cross-locale operation (six). §3 "Khonsu: Cross-Locale Operation": 3.1 track ownership (epoch defined here; ownership separate from radio); 3.2 forecast-driven preparation (crossing probability defined as summed mode probability, deterministic CV projection in the implementation; lead equation L = T_xfer + T_import + T_refresh + M); 3.3 migrated track state (table, plain prose); 3.4 prepare and commit (description-list protocol, connected ego separately with position-based binding, epoch rule, idempotence under faults); 3.5 publication and fallback (five checks with the extrapolation step stated concretely, freshness and consistency equations with d = displacement error and epsilon = source steady-state error, fallback table). Moved: 4/4 vs 3/4 result to §5.3 only; band baseline to §5.5; EMA/0.6 s/350 ms/2.5 s constants to §4.2; eight fault scenarios to §5.8; unconnected-actor discussion to a short assumption plus §7. Intro's central question restated at metropolitan scale with the three sub-problems. Evaluation opener follows the §2 chain. 13 pp with tags, no undefined refs.

## 2026-09-04 (writing session, late): systems-prose pass on the NSDI draft

- Abstract and intro rewritten again (492cfa2) to the reviewer's models: Safety Envelope directness for the abstract (no Conductor, SSM, epochs, or baseline list; three headline placeholders), Conductor cadence for the intro (physical opening, Conductor as scaffolding in paragraph 2, one central question, definitions after motivation, three enumerated contributions). Intro ends inside page 2. Writing standard going forward: short concrete sentences, system behavior first, definitions after motivation, one central question at most, ordinary verbs.

- Pages 1-2 redline applied on top (37081fa): abstract answers four things with no Conductor, no example, no baseline list beyond reactive/overlap/replication/oracle; intro paragraphs in the reviewer's plain form (Conductor as prior work in paragraph 2, 300 ms and tau(u) separated, tracker and cold-start split into two paragraphs, neutral migration positioning, three bulleted contributions, epoch wording "highest committed ownership epoch"); "warm" defined at first use in \S3. Intro ends inside page 2.

- Reviewer pass 4 applied (scale_out_nsdi f5dadc9): three-panel Figure 1 deleted (canvas plot is Figure 1; a small PREPARE/COMMIT sequence figure sits in §3); RQ paragraph removed from the intro (RQs stay in the deck and as the evaluation's internal structure); intro paragraph 2 in the reviewer's plain form; §2.2 and §2.3 collapsed (Singer/IMM/vision refs moved to Related Work; "colder of the two tracks" and the v/a walkthrough gone); §3 mechanical (two independent changes, t_o and t_c only with Delta_use <= tau(u), PREPARE/COMMIT paragraph, two numbered success conditions, record table, fallback table, trigger paragraph without adjectives, band described as a baseline); §4.2 module inventory cut; §5 opener "four parts", parameter table, topic-style subsection titles, corridor as figure + table + three sentences; load-driven migration deleted (one future-work sentence); overlap discussion in §7 cut to one paragraph; conclusion halved; intent tags shortened. Purge list clean in the PDF; no overfull boxes; 13 pages with tags.
- Deck: v6 (21 slides, illustrative expected-shape figures) pushed to gtvault and committed at slides/ with builder, toy_figs.py, and PNGs.

## 2026-09-04 (writing session): reframe to "from one locale to metropolitan scale"; four RQs; corridor capstone

- Paper (scale_out_nsdi e7ae5c7): abstract and intro open from Conductor's one-locale result and pose the main question (scale to a metropolitan deployment while preserving planner-usable predictions); four RQs (scale-out, state continuity, safe handoff, multi-locale operation) with section map; the 220-450 ms envelope is cited as motivation from unpublished earlier experiments and re-measured per scenario in a new §5 "Safe-age limit per handoff scenario" (T12); new §5 "Multi-locale operation on a corridor" (T13) as the RQ4 capstone with route-level metrics in four groups. Title still Tyler's call (candidates: "Khonsu: Scaling Cooperative Prediction Across Edge Locales" / "State Continuity for Multi-Locale Cooperative Prediction").
- Deck (scale_out_nsdi slides/khonsu_story.pptx f6ddf4c, builder slides/build_khonsu_story.py; gtvault push completed after Tyler closed the file, byte-verified): 16 slides in the research-program order: Conductor solved one locale -> metropolitan scale + main question + RQ1-4 -> RQ1 canvas/geometry -> partitioning problem (A/B/C schematic) -> RQ2 state (microbench, acceleration) -> safety condition (envelope re-measured) -> RQ3 alternatives, mechanism, evidence so far, overlap -> RQ4 corridor schematic + evaluation -> done/running/missing.
- Eval session on T13: conditional yes for Sep 15 with a go/no-go on a 3-locale corridor smoke by end of Sep 9; descoping order if not: 3 locales, 5 arms (drop overlap/replication, already measured two-locale), core metrics first. Risks: two-locale assumptions in the flow runner, latent scenario bugs, GPU contention (build proceeds on a branch in parallel). T12 covers blind overtake / acceleration / stopped lead / LTAP; SCP needs a small scenario build and will be named as a gap.

## 2026-09-03 (writing session, night): vocabulary and definition pass on the NSDI draft

- Reviewer pass 3 applied (scale_out_nsdi 8296261): one term per concept (locale, edge server, actor, track, observation history, temporal track state, source/destination locale vs edge, locale handoff vs radio handover, final update, ownership epoch); every term defined at first use (abstract defines actors; intro defines track, planner, freshness budget, locale handoff, temporal track state, warm, ownership epoch; MTR, AB3DMOT, NHTSA, p95 expanded); 300 ms operating deadline vs 220-450 ms maneuver freshness budget vs 130 ms compute allocation distinguished; success stated as two conditions (age below budget; first forecast within tolerance); "single-writer" replaced by "one current owner + epoch check at the planner"; five import checks as a list; long sentences split; "reduces error by a factor of 2.8 to 9.3" everywhere; Figure 1 relabeled (Fusion cost bounds locale size; final update + commit (ownership epoch); temporal track state). Intent tags restored on all 86 paragraphs (reviewer treats them as required). 15 pp with tags on.
- Remaining "learned state" occurrence is the paper title (Tyler's call).

## 2026-09-03 (writing session, late): NSDI draft restructured to conventional systems-paper form

- Per the second external review pass: intro rewritten as six paragraphs (service, why locales with the canvas bound, state-continuity problem, tracker dependency with the scoped SSM-integration claim, prior systems gap, Khonsu) plus three contributions; chain table removed; motivation = scaling with locales (system model folded in) / why tracking requires temporal state / the locale-handoff cold start; design merged with the old architecture section (overview and ownership model, trigger, per-track state, prepare/update/commit, import validation and fallback); implementation gains the 3D SSM tracker integration subsection; evaluation subsections retitled result-first (5.1 temporal state preserves tracking quality, 5.2 cold starts propagate to planner failures, 5.3 when proactive migration is required, 5.4 end-to-end comparison, 5.5 scalability and robustness, 5.6 locale sizing); related work and limitations are their own short sections; discussion retired. Intent tags dropped. 13 pages with refs, 0 errors, no undefined refs.
- Vocabulary: no "world model"; "temporal track state" / "per-track state"; scaffolding phrases removed (memory: feedback_no_argument_scaffolding).
- Still red: headline numbers, full scenario set, trigger table, end-to-end table, fault table, sizing surface, T8 transport. v3 sweep 32/75 at 19:54; eval session reports on landing.

## 2026-09-03 (eval session, relayed): T2 root cause = missing scenario env contract

- khonsu_design_sweep.sh never set ONCOMING_SPEED=12 TRIGGER_DIST=300; every validated run (warm/kf flip, clean tables) had them. v1 AND v2 sweeps ran the unvalidated geometry (mixed 8/6 m/s oncoming, 150 m trigger), which reproduces the marginal commit geometry and the truck wedge. Controlled pair (warm, BEHAVIOR_DEBUG): bare env 1 episode / 762 raw contact ticks / no completion; contract env 0 / 0 / completes. The "30 contact ticks" figure was the collision-sensor history_size=30 buffer cap.
- Fix pushed: contract values are runner defaults (os.environ.setdefault) in flow_gt, burst_gt, flow_single. Frozen lights stay (not the cause).
- Consequences: v2 rows discarded; v1 relative findings provisional until v3; absolute-rate embargo until v3. v3 (6 arms x 10 + 15 burst, corrected scenario) relaunched ~26 h, then q5 scale, then s5 lookahead redo. Requested: canonical reproduction check at ecc4b092 with the contract env (would revise the August provenance alert from "irreproducible" to "env-dependent").

## 2026-09-03 (writing session): NSDI draft reframed after external review

- External review (2/5 today, competitive if fixed) verified against code: payload migrates explicit history banks (memo/diff, 56K bytes) not a hidden state (`hidden_state` reserved, never set; no MTR cache); COMMIT text tied to radio while harness commits per track on geometric crossing; single-writer claim contradicted by the failure model; transport parametric; Falcon/LLM-state systems uncited; TrackSSM bib wrong (real: Bin Hu et al., arXiv 2409.00487).
- Paper now (scale_out_nsdi ffeef16, 54ef3e5): "per-actor temporal inference state" replaces latent/hidden state; "one send" retracted, design = prepare + versioned delta at commit; per-actor COMMIT on polygon entry (ego also on binding move); epoch field + consumer fencing; explicit fault model; three contributions; related work on unit/trigger/criterion with Falcon, Megaphone, Llumnix, CacheGen, DejaVu, Mooncake, VIPS, Harbor; byte audit (1.3 KB, >80% explicit history; KF 448 B); sizing scoped to "our architecture"; computed trigger stated as implemented (EMA + 3 edge cycles + 0.35 s, cap 2.5 s); ownership-layer 8-scenario verification paragraph; frozen-lights hardening + FLOW_N + burst definition in methodology.
- Not yet: headline numbers (placeholders), 12-page trim (19 pp with ptags, refs at p16), ARC citation (metadata unverified), Falcon co-authors entered as "and others".
- Orchestration: eval session is the peer at uds 4031 (ListAgents `...-8d [72d64c]`); T7-T11 handed over via docs/agent_plans/nsdi_push_tasks.md; v2 hardened sweep running; T7 unit layer done (fault_injection_results.csv); T8 netem needs Tyler's sudo.

## PROVENANCE ALERT: canonical flow table not reproducible (2026-08-31)

Design-sweep campaign completed 150/150 on a uniform stack, then
bisection showed the canonical q4 flow table (ecc4b092) does not
reproduce from its own commit on today's environment (all probes grind
at the truck; canonical warm was 4/4 clean). Not the code: planner, GT
injection, full core, full canonical tree all probed. Also: reactive/
edgewarp never fired transfers in flow_gt (zero-horizon trigger bug,
fixed 4ccd5906), so those canonical rows are cold-with-other-seeds.
DO NOT cite q4_flow_table.csv numbers going forward. Valid relative
signals from the new sweep: lead time drives completion monotonically;
bands over-fire vs forecast trigger; fixed reactive beats cold. Next:
harden scenario determinism (light phase / oncoming gap structure),
re-baseline everything, add warm lookahead {2,3,4} arms. Details:
raw/sessions/2026-08-31.md.

## Khonsu design-study campaign IN FLIGHT (2026-08-28)

Committee-mandated design studies running in
evaluation_outputs/khonsu_design_sweep_v1 (12 configs x 10 reps, ~10 h):
trigger axis (predictive vs boundary bands 5-80 m vs at-crossing), commit
refresh, mirroring rate, headline-arm seed top-up. Harness commit
9d5e1883 (band trigger vs DESTINATION locale, COMMIT_REFRESH,
MIRROR_PERIOD_S, [RUNROW] self-describing summary with deduped episodes
+ binary collided). Extract with scripts/khonsu_design_extract.py.
Sweep script resumable: rerun scripts/khonsu_design_sweep.sh with same
LOGDIR to continue after any interruption. Dissertation gained the
why-not-overlap subsection (6.1.1), the band-trigger analysis, and the
ownership-handshake protocol reframe; results from this campaign fill
their measured arms. Details: raw/sessions/2026-08-28.md.

## Post-defense follow-up underway (2026-08-27)

Proposal document revised per committee (communication -> future-work
landscape study, timeline reallocated to Khonsu depth), pushed.
Dissertation repo created at ~/repos/dissertation, seeded from proposal
with per-chapter EXPAND agendas tracing to defense feedback; compiles.
Next: Khonsu design studies, envelope sensor-fusion related work, ISPASS
rewrite. Details in raw/sessions/2026-08-27.md.

## Proposal DEFENDED (2026-08-27); committee reshapes scope

Defense happened; recording transcribed and digested into
`~/repos/Dissertation_proposal/notes/defense_feedback_2026-08-27.md`
(transcript alongside). Verdict positive (Sukrit Kalra "definitive
dissertation" comparison) with binding redirections: communication
architecture demoted from proposed work to future-work landscape study
(proposal document must be revised to match); deepen Khonsu instead
(overlap-vs-adjacent locale study, two-phase transfer benefit
measurement, event-based trigger cost-budget, context-vs-Kalman
ablation, collision metric fix); dissertation depth additions (sensor
fusion/particle filter framing, control-theory positioning, RSU cost
trade-off, physics model citations); ISPASS rewrite with positioning
table up front; NSDI September aspirational, slip acceptable. Writing
flagged as too jargony again; de-jargoning rules now in memory
(feedback_writing_simply).

## Defense deck shipped (2026-08-26 evening, defense tomorrow)

Final final: 66 slides (design-space transition slide added at 5),
fragment bullets + paragraph-spacing fill deck-wide, methodology slide
rewritten to Kishore's dictated structure (3 scenarios / 3 axes / found
timing-vs-logic), GT slide before system design (Tyler's swap), all of
Tyler's evening slide edits ported with formatting. Pushed and
byte-verified on gtvault. Talk script synced (core 1-39).

## Defense deck final (2026-08-26, defense Thursday 2026-08-27)

Final build pushed and byte-verified on gtvault. Post-freeze rounds:
Anirudh email (transition tease, bold takeaways, trims), Tyler's narration
recorded over slides 1-36 and transcribed into the notes verbatim-cleaned
(~40 min delivery, on target), and the Kishore meeting round (status chips
removed, phrases not sentences deck-wide, fonts up, slide 10 grid-only,
slide 15 containers 1..N + bold takeaway, pertinence-first locale opener,
stage notes). Khonsu section is 4 slides with the 50-seed headline table.
Narrated copy preserved as proposal_defense_recorded_2026-08-25.pptx.
Deck is 65 slides, backups at 39. Session details in
raw/sessions/2026-08-25.md.

## Defense deck frozen (2026-08-25, defense Thursday 2026-08-27)

proposal_defense.pptx (68 slides, ~/repos/Dissertation_proposal) frozen
after absorbing three committee-adjacent feedback emails (Harshit, Difei,
Jinsun), the lab dry run, and five narrated recording passes. Five
research questions spine on dividers/map/closing slide; freshness-first
order (Jinsun); locale scene rebuilt with RSU camera box, base-station
tower, elbowed fiber backhaul (commit 17300bf, on gtvault). Talk script
regenerated from deck notes: 5016 spoken words, ~35 min at 145 wpm plus
Q&A holds; target 40-45 delivered. Only typo fixes allowed now. NSDI
evaluation.tex rewritten to six-step ground-up narrative with named arms.
Details in raw/sessions/2026-08-25.md.

## Conductor deep-dive defense note written (2026-08-22)

Study document for the proposal defense at
`~/repos/Dissertation_proposal/notes/paper_deep_dive_conductor.md`: full
Conductor recall (pipeline, cliff, mechanisms, all result numbers, \ad{}
resolutions, weak flanks from the rebuttal, drill table) plus a list of
internal numeric inconsistencies to know before Q&A (11+8K fit vs measured
114 ms at K_cav=22; scale claims N=32/24/12; 220 vs 234 ms aggregations).
Details in raw/sessions/2026-08-22.md.

## SEC 2026 travel grant package drafted (2026-08-18)

Application materials in `~/repos/sec2026_travel_grant/`: request letter
(1 page, PDF), advisor recommendation letter draft for Kishore (commits to
covering uncovered expenses; email to haofanc@hawaii.edu or upload), CV
rebuilt from tlandle.github.io/cv.md as PDF, cost estimate ($2,050: reg $500
est, ATL-SJC Delta $450, 4 hotel nights $1,000, ground $100), form answers in
applicant_info.md. SEC 2026 is Santa Clara, CA, Oct 13-16 2026. Deadline
Sep 28 2026 23:59 EST. Letter states SRC non-participation; flip if entering.
Registration estimate pending 2026 rates. Receipts must be saved; award
requires main-program registration proof.

## ISPASS E6 divergence ladder built (2026-08-13, commit c2cbb762)

Design: docs/agent_plans/ispass_divergence_scenarios.md. Primary axis is K
(perception-enabled contributor count), not a binary; divergence-vs-K is
the headline figure. Built: skip_model knob in WorldFusionEdge (oracle arm
pays no fusion compute; existing gt injection = C-lat control: GT content
+ real latency); arm configs openscenario_1_e6a_oracle / e6clat_gt_latency
/ e6b_ego_local (C-K1 = existing edge_worldfusion); scripts/e6_sweep.sh
(dry-run default, E6_GO=1 to execute, GPU-gated, idempotent, generates
weather variants w1/w2 on the fly); scripts/e6_divergence_metrics.py
(log parser, regexes need refining against first smoke run). C-K2+ needs
one live iteration: CAVs bind by index to XML-spawned actors (config spawn
path commented out), so observer contributors need XML + scenario-behavior
+ config changes, build path in the plan doc. NO RUNS YET (GPU gate).

## Papers block update (08-08/08-09): proposal comment rounds

Three more Overleaf comment rounds merged and addressed (through 5ccee07):
ecav chapter (ground-truth naming replaces world-queried, related-work
three-cluster rewrite, tick-barrier detail + component-role architecture
figure, capstone→Platform Evaluation, behavior/SUMO argument); paper1
(self-ghosting frequent not dominant per Tyler, boundary-figure pointer,
cost claim scoped to late fusion + V2X2V); paper3 scale-up (fusion
boundary lead-in + comparison figure, direct CMP 0.48-vs-0.90 comparison,
Evaluation/Contributions now published results); paper5 scale-out
(boundary-before-conflict figure, overlap-cannot-substitute argument,
live two-edge results: ~4 s trigger, ~440 B/track, zero collisions);
milestones reordered to document order (eCAV→ISPASS Dec, comm arch→
SenSys/MobiSys fall, scale-out→NSDI Sep, proposal removed from schedule);
"world model" retired document- and deck-wide; "service continuity"
renamed scale-out. Deck schedule slide + thesis slide synced.

## Papers block (2026-08-05 → 08-07, separate session; details in raw/sessions/2026-08-07.md)

SEC camera-ready is acmart-converted with full author set (Daglis dual
Edinburgh+GT affiliation) and lives in the new Overleaf-linked repo
github.com/tlandle/Scalable-Edge-Fusion-SEC-Short-Paper; rights-form
values still TODO. Extended version has the same authors and a working
\thanks footnote (IEEEoverridecommandlockouts); verified arXiv tarball
delivered, upload on Tyler. Proposal: 08-07 Overleaf comment round
addressed — thesis is now a single falsifiable sentence (no second
paragraph, per Tyler), comm study reframed requirements→support→gap,
eCAV bib de-anonymized to arXiv:2506.16535, ISPASS named, 100 ms cited
(TS 22.186), SEC marked to-appear; deck thesis slide regenerated to
match. Still paused on GPU go-ahead: 16 of 39 selector locales.

## BLIND OVERTAKE COMPLETE — run 60, zero collisions (2026-08-05)

Single-locale baseline WORKS end to end on openscenario_1_edge_worldfusion
(WF + mamba3dmot + MTR stage-1 + local YOLO layer): brake 40.9 km/h →
staged stop x=299 (15.7 m gap) → hold ~30 s while 3 oncoming Leons pass
(quick-check vetoes them correctly) → commit from the staged stop →
opposing-lane swing (max y 199.6) → pass truck at 278 → merge back at
x≈253 → resume route west to 218. ZERO collision warnings.
Run 59's [COMMIT ATTEMPT] probe had already shown pre-check passing; the
last blocker was the frozen num_overtake_collisions counter (run-52 hold
returned before the reset). Full defect chain runs 43-60 documented in
the sections below. CONFIRMED run 61: identical phase-for-phase repeat
(commit at 298.7, return at 286.1, zero collisions). Next: freeze this
baseline (commit), then two-locale split; demote debug prints to
logger.debug after the two-locale runs.

## Right-merge WF stack swap (2026-08-05, in flight)

New pair: openscenario_multi_edge_right_merge_worldfusion (.yaml/.py) —
Jordan's Scenario B harness with both edges on worldfusion_mamba_adaptive
+ mamba-MTR (late_fusion original kept as the B1 ablation arm). Per-edge:
scenario_1's tracker_cfg/worldfusion_model/mtr_predictor blocks,
world_anchor at the RSU (55,141 / 230,141), RSUs backend: worldfusion
with the Multi-V2X lidar profile, cav1 backend: worldfusion (contributes
features; local YOLO layer active via the fixed detect()). Migration:
WorldFusionMambaAdaptiveEdge now borrows _PluggableEdgeBase's
tracker-agnostic export/import surface (mamba memo-bank latent via
migration.factories) as class attributes, overriding the AB3DMOT-only
mixin — prerequisites (tracker wrapper, beacon_id_mgr, track_to_carla,
_vm_by_carla_id) verified present on the WF chain. Generic runner
script: scratchpad/run_scenario.sh <test> <log>.

Right-merge WF runs 1-4:
- Run 1: CUDA OOM at second edge's MTR load (Town06 CARLA 7 GB + NX
  desktop ~6 GB leaves ~3 GB; two full model copies don't fit). Fix:
  shared eval-mode instances keyed by checkpoint — _SHARED_MTR_MODELS in
  mtr_edge_predictor, _EDGE_WF_MODEL_CACHE in the WF edge manager
  (perception managers already shared via cav_world). Sim-hosting
  optimization only; deployment is one edge per server.
- Run 2: full init, sim ran 180 steps, EGO handoff FIRED at tick 61
  ([TRANSFER_COST] vid=120 bytes=160 network_ms=63.8 — 160 B = empty
  latent, ego tracklet identity unresolved; warm-latent quality TBD).
  Crash: runner's AB3DMOT-specific debug (tracker.trackers) at the NPC
  transfer → made tracker-agnostic (also fixed kf.x[1]→kf.x[2] height
  bug in the original diagnostic).
- Run 3: full 700 steps. Confirmed: mamba export path is identity-only,
  NPC transfer returned None forever. DEEPER: at crossing, ALL 8-14
  tracks on the source edge sat 19-30 m off-road laterally (y=120 /
  158-172, road y≈140) and the NPC was never tracked — RSU mast z=7.0
  in Jordan's harness vs ~3 m in Multi-V2X training and the working
  scenario_1 config → returns below the model's z window, all-ghost
  detections.
- Run 4 fixes: RSU spawn z 7.0→3.0 (both RSUs); position fallback added
  to the mamba branch of export_tracked_obstacle_state (same contract
  as the AB3DMOT branch — nearest tracklet within max_dist_m stamped
  with the caller-supplied persistent id).
- Run 4 RESULT — TWO-LOCALE RELAY STACK WORKS END TO END, zero
  collisions, zero tracebacks, full 700 steps:
  * PREDICTIVE OBSTACLE HANDOFF tick=158: NPC mamba memo-bank latent
    (440 B, 4 frames) exported from locale_0 at npc_x=98.3 (1.0 s
    horizon before the x=115 boundary), warm-injected into locale_1
    (mamba tid=88). No reactive retries needed.
  * ADVANCE-WARNING WINDOW = 82 ticks (4.1 s): locale_1 held a live NPC
    track 4.1 s before RSU1 in-range (tick 240). The paper's core
    scale-out claim, measured live on the production stack.
  * Ego ownership handoff locale_0->locale_1 at tick 61 (160 B — empty
    latent/cold start; ego tracklet identity unresolved on source edge:
    known quality item, warm ego handoff TBD).
  * Ego merged right around the blockage (lane -3 y≈137 → lane -4
    y≈140) and continued 181 m through both locales.
  Both paper scenarios now work: blind overtake (runs 60/61) +
  right-merge two-locale (run 4). Remaining: warm EGO handoff (identity
  resolution), two-locale blind overtake, distributed variants, Q1-Q6 +
  B0-B6 sweeps, locale→compute→physical diagram.
- Runs 5-6: _stamp_nearest_tracklet extracted (pluggable base) and used
  by export_vehicle_state (5 m gate; tracklet cid=-1 everywhere live,
  so exports resolve identity by known pose). Run 5 crashed: the WF
  manager borrows methods individually and the new helper wasn't in the
  borrow list (added; post-deadline TODO: extract a real
  TrackerAgnosticMigrationMixin). Run 6: NPC handoff metrics reproduced
  exactly (tick 158, 440 B, 82-tick window); ego handoff legitimately
  cold in THIS scenario (crosses 3 s after spawn, 45+ m from RSU0 — no
  track exists to ship; two-locale blind overtake will exercise the
  warm ego path). Ego merged, reached x=308, zero collisions.
  Committed: 8de40397 (baseline), ed1ee4ca (export identity stamp).

## Two-locale blind overtake built (2026-08-06, first run in flight)

New pair: openscenario_1_two_locale_worldfusion (.yaml generated from the
single-locale yaml with anchors resolved; .py spliced from the WF
right-merge runner). Geometry: boundary x=250 (overlap 240-250);
locale_0 east (ego + carlacola + RSU0 295,200,3 = world_anchor),
locale_1 west (Leons' approach, new RSU2 180,200,3). Runner
generalizations vs right-merge: multi-NPC set (managed + hero excluded),
per-NPC predictive transfer with generic src->dst locale resolution
(right-merge hardcoded locale_0->locale_1), per-NPC advance-warning
bookkeeping vs the DESTINATION locale's RSU, per-NPC summary; MAX_STEP
1100. Expected events: 3 Leon handoffs locale_1->locale_0 pre-overtake
(latents feed the ego's clearance gate), ego handoff locale_0->locale_1
post-pass (WARM — RSU0 will have tracked the ego ~30 s, exercising the
export identity stamp).

TWO-LOCALE BLIND OVERTAKE WORKS (run 2, commit 310f9c1e):
- Run 1: overtake executed in the split config but NO Leon transfers —
  overlap-precedence bug: next()-style containment returned locale_0 in
  the 240-250 overlap, shrinking the eastbound exit-prediction window to
  ~2 ticks. Also measured: the edge never tracks its own managed
  vehicles (anchoring protocol), so the EGO handoff is cold BY DESIGN —
  managed state is beaconed exactly; tracker latents are for unmanaged
  obstacles (which is the paper's migration claim). 392 export attempts
  confirmed no ego tracklet ever exists.
- Fix: sticky locale assignment (update only on unambiguous
  containment; overlap keeps prior locale) → full overlap band is the
  trigger window in both directions.
- Run 2: Leon 200 predictive latent handoff tick 278 at (244.8,199.2)
  locale_1->locale_0, 244 B warm memo latent; Leon 199 handoff tick 301
  locale_0->locale_1 (east exit, after no-track retries); ego ownership
  handoff tick 298; overtake clean (min_x 217.5, max_y 199.7), ZERO
  collisions. Advance-warning reads 1 tick here because RSU0's 60 m
  range covers the overlap (geometry; the 4.1 s headline stays with the
  right-merge scenario). Leon 201 crossing not captured this run
  (follow-up if needed for eval counts).

## Blind overtake ROOT CAUSE FOUND: ego had no onboard perception layer (2026-08-03)

Runs 43/44 proved the entire decision chain works: blocked-state latch arms
(bt=46), wait counter drains, do_overtake commits and HOLDS ~50 ticks
(post-commit latch stand-down added: 5b now gates on `not self.do_overtake` —
run 43 showed the latched hazard routed the ladder into car-following behind
the very truck being overtaken), opposing-lane path pushed, trajectory
generated. The ego still could not move because it was already wedged against
the truck: it hit it at 39 km/h during approach with hz=0 the whole way.

Why nothing braked, two stacked mechanisms:
1. `WorldFusionPerceptionManager.detect()` returned a hardcoded EMPTY vehicle
   list ("Actual detection is performed on the edge, not here"). The ego CAV's
   yaml overrides perception to backend worldfusion, so the vehicle had NO
   onboard obstacle layer at all — collision pass 1 iterated an empty list
   every tick. Edge predictions were the only obstacle source.
2. The WF edge model has ZERO recall on the firetruck (measured run 44:
   0 detections in 36 approach cycles) AND firetruck is on the repo-wide
   exclusion list (VALID_VEHICLE_TYPES: local perception filter deletes dets
   near firetrucks; edge GT/eval sets exclude it — that is why [DET DEBUG]
   GT never contained the truck). scenario_3 already swapped firetruck→cars
   for exactly this reason; scenario_1 still used one as the OVERTAKE SUBJECT.

Fixes (run 45): (a) WF detect() now runs the inherited YOLO+lidar local
pipeline for vehicle agents (RSUs stay feature-only) — edge enhances, never
replaces; (b) scenario_1.xml subject firetruck → carlacola (whitelisted
truck, AutoCast precedent); (c) `_find_blocking_lead` scans local
obstacle_vehicles first (directly visible lead), edge predictions second
(occluded actors). Measurement trap fixed: [BRANCH] wc prints as float after
the halved restart; integer-only regexes silently drop post-commit rows
(this falsely reported run 44 as "do never fired").

Run 45→47 chain (each run exposed the next layer):
- Run 45: local layer brakes from 40 km/h but stop point converges onto the
  bumper. Cause: collision_manager pass 1 subtracted a hardcoded 3 m
  "typical vehicle length" — for truck+SUV that under-counts ~2.3 m, so
  the stop condition (distance<3) fired at ~0.5 m actual gap. In contact,
  the commit pre-check always collides; ego then PUSHED the rolling
  carlacola 60 m west while car-following its bumper. Fix: subtract real
  bounding-box half-lengths of both actors (distance = bumper gap).
- Run 46: brake onset correct (hazard at x=305, 21 m gap) but local truck
  detection flickers (18% duty) and each dropout released braking →
  sawtooth reacceleration into contact (40.9→17.5→31.7 km/h at impact).
  The RSS proper-response latch (the designed anti-oscillation mechanism)
  never engaged: its enter keys on self.ttc, which only the PREDICTION
  pass wrote; pass-1 hazards left ttc=1000. Fix: pass 1 (non-adjacent)
  writes self.ttc = gap / ego_speed.
- Run 47: collisions 415→1; RSS engaged (39 enters); ego stops without
  slamming the truck; commit fires, path pushed. Remaining: (i) stop point
  still creeps to gap≈0 via 39 RSS enter/exit-stopped/lurch cycles across
  detection dropouts; (ii) post-commit deadlock — the subject itself
  re-arms hazard (branch-8 car-following at oc>0 + RSS), parking the ego
  on its committed path forever.
Fixes (run 48): (a) update_information now UNIONS edge + local
predictions (edge wins per obstacle, 4 m dedup; was "edge active → trust
it exclusively", discarding the local tracker's coasted truck that
bridges YOLO flicker); (b) committed-overtake subject exemption: at
commit, _overtake_subject_loc recorded; both collision passes skip
obstacles within 4 m of it while do_overtake; cleared on completion.
Only oncoming traffic can abort a committed overtake.

Runs 48-53 (the approach-sawtooth kill chain; run 50 = FIRST full
maneuver execution: swing-out, pass, though launched from contact and
ended head-on with an inbound Leon):
- Run 49 falsified "target flip-flop" theory: sawtooth reproduced
  byte-identical with hazard CONTINUOUS. Instrumented branch trace
  (oa/ii/pcr/d added to [BRANCH]) shows d=0.0 (RSS-forced) on all rows.
- Wait-branch + restart-branch now HOLD (return 0) for a stationary
  subject: car-following a stopped lead at midrange gap commands ~20 km/h
  (chase), the creep source. Branch 9 also recomputes `distance` against
  the resolved subject (min-distance pricing could reference a different
  vehicle).
- RSS latch had TWO leaks, both fixed: (i) hold branch was gated on
  `not is_hazard`, but mid-brake TTC=gap/speed balloons past time_ahead →
  neither enter nor hold ran → forced stop evaporated (oscillator);
  now hold evaluates whenever TTL>0, exits only via stopped/clearing/TTL.
  (ii) obstacle-less hazard fell through the whole ladder to NORMAL
  BEHAVIOR at max speed (every hazard branch requires obstacle_vehicle);
  now is_hazard with obstacle None → return 0 (keep braking).
- Run 53: STAGED STOP ACHIEVED — single continuous brake 40.9→0,
  rest at x=299, 15.7 m bumper gap, exactly the predicted physics. But
  the stop sits OUTSIDE the arming radii (_find_blocking_lead 15/20 m,
  truck at 21 m) → blocked-overtake state never entered; each perception
  blink read as free road → accelerate-brake cycles advanced the stop
  299→278 into contact. Run 54: arming envelope widened to 30 m (both
  call sites) so the staged stop arms and the wait-hold pins the ego.

Runs 54-59 (commit-gate chain; staging now rock solid — every run holds
at x=299, 15.7 m gap, ZERO collisions for full duration):
- Run 54: hold perfect, 51 commit attempts all rejected. Pre-check
  (overtake_management set_destination=False prediction loop) lacked the
  subject exemption → added (subject cannot veto its own overtake).
- Run 56 (instrumented [PRECHECK VETO]): 80/84 vetoes were ttc=1000
  SPATIAL-OVERLAP fallbacks from stationary ghosts — chiefly a WF
  duplicate of the truck displaced into the opposing lane at
  (277.4,199.2) — plus far-future conflicts (ttc 34-73 s). Fix: veto
  only time-synchronized conflicts with ttc < 20 s (same convention as
  the main collision pass; 20 s covers the maneuver window).
- Run 58: quick adjacent-lane check also lacked the exemption during
  the WAIT phase (gated on do_overtake) — the truck flagged its own
  bypass path on ~200 ticks/run → _precheck_subject_loc recorded at
  overtake_management entry, exempted in collision_manager when
  adjacent_check.
- Run 59 ([COMMIT ATTEMPT]/[QUICKCHECK VETO] probes): pre-check PASSES
  (pre=False), quick-check vetoes are REAL Leons passing eastbound at
  y≈199. Blocker: num_overtake_collisions frozen at 44-139 because the
  run-52 restart-hold returns BEFORE the shared counter reset → first
  Leon pass poisoned every later attempt. Fix: reset inside the restart
  branch before the hold return (per-window counting restored).

## SEC ablation provenance RESOLVED: score_threshold 0.2 vs 0.15 (2026-07-21)

The April selector-ablation numbers (rsu_93 random K=4: occ recall 0.287, 5.8
dets/tick, 0 FP) are REPRODUCED locally. Root cause: the A10 ran ep39 with the
checkpoint dir's config.yaml at the training-default `score_threshold: 0.2`
(rsync'd Apr 23); the local config.yaml was lowered to 0.15 on Apr 25 during the
scene-overfit debugging, AFTER the sync, and only net_epoch39.pth was pushed
afterward. Every July rerun used 0.15 -> 0.80+ recall, ~25 FP, 11 dets/tick.
Flipping one line reproduces April: 0.296/0.345/5.9/0FP vs 0.287/0.341/5.8/0.
Eliminated by direct experiment along the way: environment (rebuilt torch
2.6.0+cu124 + numpy 1.26.4 as conda env `opencda310_apr`; identical results to
three decimals vs torch 2.9/numpy 2.2), code (Apr-27 profiler byte-reconstructed
by replaying 54 transcript Edit calls onto the Apr-20 git base; detection path
identical to today's), checkpoint (PACE->local->A10->LFS chain closed, same
bytes). Full dossier:
~/repos/cooperative_world_model_prediction/rebuttal/ablation_provenance.md.
CAUTION: the July 16-locale selector distribution (median G -14%) was measured at
0.15; it reflects the saturating operating point and must be re-run at 0.2 before
being cited. Verification of oracle_occluded + causal_v4 arms at 0.2 in flight
(paper2/paper2_figures/rebuttal_sweep/verify_rsu93_*_thresh02.csv). reproduce/
README needs score_threshold pinned at 0.2. Note: current profiler defaults
num_output_steps=50 vs April's 25 (MTR horizon, prediction-only; not
detection-relevant but matters for ADE comparisons).

## Scale-out B0.3 DONE (mechanism): LIVE full-latent migration in CARLA (2026-07-05)

First live learned-state handoff: scenario `openscenario_3_multi_edge_mamba` (both
edges SOTA pluggable + mamba3dmot + late-fusion + linear). At tick 60 the ego's
full memo bank (10 frames, 776 B) exported from edge0 and injected warm at edge1;
tracklet survived; no post-handoff exceptions. Fixes en route: beacon KeyError on
freshly-migrated VM in late_fusion_backend.detect (tolerate miss); temp-id vs
carla_id mismatch (pluggable export resolves via get_carla_id_for_temp). Known
gaps: warm-vs-cold DELTA needs B4 metrics; SOTAEdge.evaluate() NotImplementedError
at cleanup (non-fatal). CARLA left running headless for further live analysis.

## Scale-out B0.2 DONE (unit level): Mamba latent migrates through the edge dispatch (2026-07-05)

Mamba3DMOT registered in the tracker registry (lazy torch import; AB3DMOT-only
processes stay torch-free). Wrapper now carries carla_id (nearest-det assoc, 2 m
gate) and exposes `.tracker`. `_PluggableEdgeBase` export/import dispatches on
backend: Mamba -> full latent via factories, AB3DMOT -> KFState; fixes the
pre-existing `self.tracker.trackers` wrapper-indirection bug. Schema-mismatch
records cold-start cleanly. Both branches verified under opencda310
(test_mamba_edge_migration.py): banks byte-identical, id preserved, ~1.3 KB.
Next: B0.3 live two-edge run with `tracker: mamba3dmot` YAML. Uncommitted -> committed this session.

## NSDI paper: systems positioning + Kishore methodology complete (2026-07-07)

Pushed through 33c8a07 (scale_out_nsdi). Related work opens with the problem-class
abstraction (pre-copy/post-copy, TCP/QUIC cwnd, stream-processor state shipping vs
replay, leases, 802.11r; all citations verified) + camera-networks subsection
(Javed ICCV'03, smart-camera handoff, Spatula SEC'20) + ClairvoyantEdge (Kishore's
group, SEC'22, prepare-ahead pattern; distinction: content re-fetchable, our state
exists only at source). System model corrected per Tyler: locale anchors to the
CONFLICT ZONE (map), not the RSU; RSU = viewpoint; edge = base-station server
(memory: project_locale_definition). Boundary framing after Alex's pushback:
"static canvas, dynamic assignment, ASYMMETRIC elasticity" (shrink = crop, growth
capped by trained extent + edge budget ~8MB/frame BEV; dynamic policies generate
migration workload). 74 visible \ptag intent tags + AV-term glosses for systems
reviewers (planner, tracking, ADE/FDE/minADE/miss/NLL defined, LTAP-OD/SCP
expanded, ns-3/CARLA/AoI/V2X/backhaul glossed). 15pp clean build. Tyler reading
both manuscripts next. Professor email drafted in chat (bulleted, with data audit).

## Dissertation proposal alignment (2026-07-02, repo tlandle/Dissertation_proposal)

Pushed through `2388679`. P1 skeleton: five research thrusts standardized (eCAV
platform is its own thrust per Tyler), chapter order fixed (communication before
scale-up), paper4 file renamed, 64-agent claim corrected to 33, dup bib entry +
dup labels removed. P2: scale-out chapter rewritten to match the expanded NSDI
paper (architecture contract, Q1-Q6, measured microbenchmark, honest one-frame
labeling; NO codename, Tyler rejected "RELAY"). P3: correctness chapter rewritten
as completed work with the submitted paper's real numbers (100-150ms logic cliff,
350-400ms physics boundary, 220-450ms budgets, m(a,u,N), ~10KB/s + <0.2ms).
Kishore methodology adopted: visible \ptag paragraph-intent tags (59 tags across
abstract/intro/paper1/paper5), sentence-builds-on-previous rule, eval overview +
takeaways. ALL PHASES DONE (pushed ad7ee57, 2026-07-05): P4 related-work rebuilt (one thread
per thrust, mis-citations fixed, definitions added); P5 all chapters tagged (111
visible Intent tags), eCAV chapter rewritten to prose, paper3/paper4 cited,
timeline dedup, em-dashes/banned words swept; P6 13 shared bib entries reconciled
to the papers' canonical definitions. Clean build, 60 pages, 0 warnings.
research-plan.tex stays in repo unused (Tyler's call). Tags stay visible until
advisors approve, then flip the one-line macro in main.tex.

## Scale-out B0.1 DONE: live edge migrates KF state (2026-06-30)

B0 step 1 built + unit-verified. Fixed the `import numpy` bug in
`edge_manager_pluggable_base.py`. Added real `export_vehicle_state`/`import_vehicle_state`
(AB3DMOT KFState: mean, covariance, hits>=min_hits, velocity) to the live
`PredictionLateFusionEdge` so a handoff actually carries tracker state (was a base no-op).
Round-trip verified under opencda310 (scratchpad `test_kf_migration.py`): destination KF
resumes warm, matches source, migrated velocity present (cold start would be 0), payload
~1.0 KB. This is the Reactive-Kalman baseline arm. The predictor on this edge is LINEAR so
KF state suffices here; the learned-latent advantage needs B0.2 (Mamba+MTR eval edge, TODO).
Not yet run in the live CARLA loop (B0.3). Changes uncommitted (commit only when asked).

## RELAY (Paper 3 NSDI) eval plan + live-migration audit (2026-06-30)

Paper `github.com/tlandle/scale_out_nsdi` expanded (architecture contract, Q1-Q6 eval,
5-subsection related work, canonical shared bib). Wrote
[scale_out_evaluation.md](../../agent_plans/scale_out_evaluation.md).

Audit finding (critical): the live multi-edge scenario
(`openscenario_3_multi_edge_late_fusion.py`) is a Phase-1 skeleton. It swaps VM
ownership and logs a TransferCost but migrates NO tracker state (base `import_vehicle_state`
is a no-op), triggers on a hardcoded tick (HANDOFF_TICK=60, not geometry), applies no
backhaul delay (link computes cost, never gates), and persists no warm-vs-cold metrics.
The AB3DMOT KFState path (`edge_manager_pluggable_base.py`) is unreachable live (only
SOTA/Adaptive edges); the full Mamba latent path is only in `harness.py`. The live edge
runs AB3DMOT+linear (stateless predictor), so NO gap appears there. Linchpin build (B0):
run the learned stack (Mamba3DTracker + MTR) on the eval edge and wire the real
export/inject so state actually migrates. Only then is any live paper claim backed. The
synthetic harness B/B1/B0 microbenchmark stays the mechanism result; Q1/Q4 must come from
the live closed loop. Minor bug: `edge_manager_pluggable_base.py` uses `np.*` with no
`import numpy`.

## WF→MTR (CMP-style) data generation — IN PROGRESS, key findings (2026-06-29)

Goal: train MTR on WorldFusion fused BEV features (like CMP trains MTR on
CoBEVT features), for Multi-V2X. Scaffolded PACE training planned
(1→2→8 GPU). Plan artifacts written under `docs/agent_plans/` pending.

**Pipeline pieces written (all in `ecav/core/prediction/mtr/`):**
- `tools/export_wf_for_mtr.py` — WF forward per Multi-V2X frame → dumps
  fused_feature `.npy` (float16, [1,256,176,176], ~8MB/frame) + AB3DMOT
  tracks → pred_traj pickle. Plain `.npy`; transfer compression is plain
  `tar` (NOT gz), per Tyler.
- `datasets/multiv2x_multiego_dataset.py` (+ registered in `datasets/__init__.py`,
  mirrored into CMP `MTR/mtr/datasets/`) — MTR loader. Loads gt/pred pickles,
  lane PNG (Swin lane encoder kept — `models/lane_maps/` has 56 RSU-static
  256x256 PNGs covering all 44 zones), WF fused feature, RSU pose.
- `tools/build_multiv2x_intention_points.py` — K=64 endpoint clusters →
  `multiv2x_cluster_64_center_dict.pkl`. DONE (149k endpoints).
- `tools/cfgs/multiv2x/multiv2x_multiego_worldfusion.yaml` — MTR config,
  FUTURE=25 (5s@5Hz), PAST=10, lane Swin, intention pkl. DONE.
- `tools/rekey_pred_to_gt_ids.py` — Hungarian-match tracks to GT ids.
  SUPERSEDED by the frame finding below; revisit.
- Patched `point_pillar_worldfusion.py::forward` to return `fused_feature`.

**CORRECT MODEL: `worldfusion_multiv2x_translaug_finetune`** (translation-aug
fine-tune, fixes scene-overfit per [[project_wf_scene_overfit]]). Pulled from
PACE `$PROJECT/worldfusion_translaug_finetune/...` to
`ecav/ml_manager/models/worldfusion_multiv2x_translaug_finetune/`
(epochs 27,45 local). NOT `caronly_aug` epoch27 (that was a wrong earlier pick;
its result.txt AP 0.674 was never re-evaluated and it scene-overfits).
`result.txt` for translaug is empty (never AP-evaluated).

**CORRECT DECODE (matches live `WorldFusionEdge._to_ab3dmot_format`):**
- Use `WorldVoxelPostprocessor` (NOT the opv2v `VoxelPostprocessor` the
  MultiV2X dataset builds — that ego-recenters → garbage x[6,54]).
- world_anchor=[[0,0,0,0,0,0]], lidar_pose=origin, `corner_to_center(order='hwl')`.
- Offline fusion is in RSU-LOCAL frame (dataset pairwise warps to RSU-ego),
  so apply FULL `x_to_world(rsu_pose)` (rotation+translation). NOTE: live
  edge manager adds translation ONLY because it pre-warps to world-aligned via
  `_compute_world_pairwise_transforms` — offline does NOT, so rotation needed.
  export_wf_for_mtr.py was edited to WorldVoxelPP + RSU translation; STILL
  NEEDS the rotation (x_to_world) re-added — current code applies translation
  only and is WRONG for offline.

**RESOLVED (2026-06-30): build everything in RSU-EGO frame, GT-anchored.**
The old `multiv2x_gt_traj` pickle WAS complete (matches yaml exactly) and in
CARLA world. The recall-0 confusion was two compounding mistakes:
(1) world-frame reconciliation (`x_to_world` + opv2v postprocessor) was wrong;
(2) AB3DMOT fragmented the intermittent RSU-range detections into ~2 short
ghost tracks/frame (this is the KNOWN live ~9-tick-track issue, NOT new).

Final design (verified on rsu_66): everything in the RSU-EGO frame (static RSU
→ ego frame is a fixed, world-consistent frame). Per frame:
- GT boxes + CARLA ids straight from `item['ego']['object_bbx_center']` +
  `object_ids` (order 'hwl' = [x,y,z,h,w,l,yaw]).
- Pred detections via `WorldVoxelPostprocessor` (world_anchor+lidar_pose at
  origin), `corner_to_center('hwl')`. NO transform — same ego frame as GT.
- Associate detections → GT ids by gated Hungarian (gate 2.0m). Pred-past and
  gt-future BOTH keyed by CARLA id. NO AB3DMOT, NO rekey step (dropped).
  GT-anchored association is standard for building prediction training data;
  detection POSITIONS stay the model's noisy output, only association uses GT.

Verified rsu_66 numbers: detection pos error mean 0.42m / median 0.39m;
per-frame recall 44%; 1086 lenient trainable center-samples/zone; 0 false
centers (all pred keyed to real GT ids). CMP-strict (gapless 11-frame past) = 0
because detection is intermittent at 44% — EXPECTED and FINE: MTR masks missing
past via obj_trajs_mask; the loader selects centers leniently (current observed
+ future valid), not strict. CMP only used strict because OPV2V perception was
dense.

LIVE TRACKER NOTE (Tyler flagged): the AB3DMOT fragmentation that broke offline
also degrades the LIVE pipeline (~9-tick tracks, known). Offline subsampling
(~10Hz vs live 20Hz) makes it look worse offline. GT-anchored association is an
OFFLINE data-gen choice only; it does NOT fix/mask the live tracker. Live
fragmentation is a separate follow-up, not part of WF→MTR data gen.

**Earlier wasted cycles (don't repeat):** ran wrong conda env (`opencda` 3.8 →
must be `opencda310`); cited AP from wrong dir (`worldfusion_multiv2x_det_*`
epoch2, 0.25, unrelated); paired x_to_world with opv2v postprocessor (double
bug). The mechanical pipeline (feature dump, loader, intention pts, config)
is sound; only the detection-frame + GT-source construction is unresolved.

**PACE training status (2026-07-02).** Full export done (11760 features, 52
zones, 174GB). Uploaded to `$PROJECT/wf_mtr_translaug.tar` (plain tar) +
`$PROJECT/mtr_code.tar`; sbatches in `$PROJECT/mtr_sbatch/` (local copies in
`ecav/core/prediction/mtr/tools/scripts/`). Smoke submitted in h200+h100 pairs
with a `$PROJECT/mtr_wf_smoke.lock` claim-lock (noclobber); ALWAYS `rm -f` the
lock before resubmitting. Two build failures fixed in ALL four sbatches:
1. `pip install -e . --use-pep517` → isolated build env has no torch, and env
   has no nvcc. Fix: `module load cuda/12.1.1` (matches torch 2.2.2+cu121),
   `pip install -e . --no-build-isolation`, `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=9.0`.
2. With the module on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, torch import dies with
   `ImportError: libcupti.so.12` (module resolves cudart from lib64 but CUPTI
   lives in `extras/CUPTI/lib64`; the env ships no pip-side cupti). Fix:
   `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"`.
Jobs 10649347/8 (fail 1), 10664466/7 (fail 2, h100 sibling scanceled).
Untar of 174GB to node NVMe takes ~15 min.
Next after smoke: 2-GPU 3-epoch, then 8-GPU 30-epoch (`mtr_wf_ddp_*.sbatch`).

**Fail 3 (job 10676504) + fixes (2026-07-03..05), all verified by a LOCAL
end-to-end training run (4080, 0.16 s/iter, loss decreasing over 3k iters):**
- `No module named transformers`: train_multiego routed MultiV2X to
  models_v2v4real, which has NO lane encoder (dead transformers import) and
  no BEV aggregator. Fixed routing: MultiV2X now uses models_opv2v (Swin lane
  encoder + MotionAggregator over fused BEV), the tree the loader was written
  against.
- `MotionAggregatorTransformer` hard-coded 50 future frames (ours 25) and a
  Linear over 48x176 BEV (WF is 176x176). Parameterized num_future_frames
  from MOTION_DECODER.NUM_FUTURE_FRAMES; added AdaptiveAvgPool2d((48,176)),
  a no-op for CoBEVT-shaped input.
- Loader emitted homegrown 8-attr trajs + 2D masks; model needs CMP's 22-attr
  layout (6 box + 2 onehot + T+1 time embed + 2 heading) and 3D masks. Ported
  CMP's create_agent_data_for_center_objects / generate_centered_trajs /
  transform_trajs_to_center_coords verbatim (opencood-free) into
  multiv2x_multiego_dataset.py.
- Yaw bug: pickles store RADIANS (verified range ±3.9); loader applied
  deg2rad. Removed.
- BatchNorm crash on records with a single valid past obs point (intermittent
  RSU detections; OPV2V never hits this). Loader skips records with <2 valid
  past points.
- CMP recipe is TWO-STAGE: stage 1 `_no_agg.yaml` (TYPE None, from scratch),
  stage 2 loads stage-1 best_model with TYPE Transformer. Created the yaml
  pair; smoke runs the stage-2 yaml with empty-pretrained fallback (joint,
  exercises the full code path).
- Swin weights staged offline at MTR/pretrained/swin-base-patch4-window7-224
  (332MB, inside mtr_code.tar; compute nodes have no internet).
- PACE transformers: 5.x needs torch>=2.4; 4.57/4.53 break on torch 2.2.2
  (`torch.compiler.is_compiling` missing). **transformers==4.51.3 works**
  (ViTImageProcessorFast, Swin forward OK); installed in opencda310.
Attempt 4 (job 10799892): died importing models_opv2v — module-level
`from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv` resolves a broken ~/.local copy
(missing psutil). Guarded with try/except in BOTH model trees (only
MotionAggregatorGCN needs it). Also stripped locally built *.so from the code
tar (torch 2.9.1 ABI, undefined symbols vs PACE torch 2.2.2; node rebuilds).

**Attempt 5 (job 10801234, 2026-07-05): TRAINING SMOKE PASSED.** Full 1-epoch
run on H200: 4820 iters, 0.20 s/iter (16 min epoch), loss ~196 at end,
checkpoint saved. Crashed only in the POST-epoch eval import:
tools/eval_utils/eval_utils.py had module-level psutil + pympler (both absent
on PACE) and `from mtr.datasets.opv2v_multiego_dataset import ...` (imports
cmp_opencood, absent on PACE). Eval fixes, all validated LOCALLY by a
functional eval run over the test split (344 records, ADE/FDE/MR computed):
- psutil/pympler moved inside eval_one_epoch (only user); OPV2V import moved
  inside its dispatch branch.
- eval_one_epoch_custom now calls `dataloader.dataset.generate_prediction_dicts`
  (was hard-coded OPV2VMultiEgoDataset). MultiV2X dataset got an opencood-free
  port of generate_prediction_dicts (assert num_feat in (5,7) so the TYPE-None
  stage-1 7-dim trajs also pass).
- Horizon indices were hard-coded for 50 frames @10 Hz (`gt_trajs[-50:]`,
  min(30/10, ...)); now derived from mask length (both datasets are 5 s
  horizons: OPV2V 50f, MultiV2X 25f).
**2-GPU DDP validation (job 10802480, 2026-07-05): PASSED.** 3 epochs on
2x H200 (2410 iters/epoch, 0.24 s/iter), eval after every epoch (472 traj/rank),
best_model saved, zero tracebacks, clean exit at 52 min. One defect: minADE=nan.
Cause: 3/931 test objects have center_gt_final_valid_idx==0 → empty ADE slice
[:0] → nan poisons the accumulator (FDE indexes [idx], stays finite; OPV2V's
dense GT never hits this). Fixed: eval skips objects with final_valid_idx<1
(counted as Filtered). Verified by a full local test-split eval: finite
metrics, Filtered: 3, Total: 928.

**8-GPU run 10804312 COMPLETED (3h19m) but the MODEL IS INVALID — training
data was corrupted by train-mode augmentation.** Both stages plateaued at
ADE ~31 m / MR ~0.98 (the static-baseline score). Diagnosis chain:
intention-point spread was lateral-dominant (±143 m) → GT pickle per-object
sequences jump 30-60 m per 0.2 s frame with yaw uniformly random vs motion →
source world-frame GT (ecav/ml_manager/models/multiv2x_mtr) is smooth
(median step 0.19 m) → ROOT CAUSE: export_wf_for_mtr.py called
`build_dataset(hypes, train=True)`; in train mode get_item_single_car applies
the translaug augmentors (random world flip / ±45° rotation / scaling /
translation) per frame, jointly to lidar + GT. Every frame sits in an
independently randomized frame: self-consistent WITHIN the frame (which is
why the 0.42 m det-vs-GT check passed) but scrambled ACROSS frames. All
exported trajectories, features, and intention points were noise; the model
correctly learned the only invariant (predict near current position).
Fixes applied:
- export_wf_for_mtr.py: `train=False` (comment explains why).
- build_multiv2x_intention_points.py: removed deg2rad on already-radian yaw
  (same bug class as the loader fix).
Regeneration DONE (2026-07-07): all 52 zones re-exported in place. Verified
across every zone: GT per-step displacement median ~0-0.8 m, max 3.1 m, zero
zones with >8 m steps (corrupted version was 30-60 m median). Intention
points rebuilt from clean GT: dx in [0, 40.8] forward-only, dy ±23 m,
longitudinal-dominant (mean |dx| 18.6 vs |dy| 6.0) — physically correct.
New 174 GB tar uploaded to $PROJECT. Run 10804312's invalid checkpoints
deleted on PACE (kept eval records/logs/tensorboard, 49 MB); PROJECT at
622G/1T. Infrastructure validation from that run still stands (DDP, eval,
staging, copy-back all work).

**CLEAN-DATA RETRAIN DONE (job 10856291, 4x H200, 2026-07-08).** The 8-GPU
job (10846208) queued >18 h; the 4-GPU sibling backfilled first and 10846208
was scanceled. Sbatches now have a READY-marker gate (`$DATA_TAR.READY`,
dropped by the uploader) so an early-scheduled job can't untar a partial tar.

**STAGE 1 (no aggregator): SUCCESS — this is the RELAY P0 model.**
minADE 5s: 3.06 (ep1) → 1.39 best (~1.45 settled); best MR(3.6) 0.221 at
epoch 7 (best_model.pth = epoch 7). CMP-quality on 44%-recall detection
pasts. Checkpoint pulled locally to
`ecav/ml_manager/models/mtr_wf_stage1/best_model.pth` (596M); full run
output (both stages, all epochs) at PACE
`$PROJECT/mtr_wf_runs/10856291/output/`.

**STAGE 2 (Transformer aggregator): DIVERGED — checkpoint unusable.**
ADE 6-8 m from the start (random aggregator decoder overwrites stage-1
trajectories), training loss nan from ~epoch 12, all later evals nan. Its
best_eval_record "MR 0.0" is a nan artifact (nan distances count no misses).
Suspects: LR 1e-4 with MTR unfrozen (`--freeze_mtr` exists but unused),
GRAD_NORM_CLIP 1000 (effectively none), 138M-param BEV flatten Linear.
**DECISION (Tyler, 2026-07-08): drop the aggregator permanently.** Not
important for our contribution and it costs edge inference time. Vanilla MTR
has NO stage 2; the two-stage recipe was purely CMP's (stage 2 = their
aggregator). Our training is therefore standard single-run MTR training.
ARCHITECTURE CLARIFICATION: in this model the WF fused BEV feature is NOT a
direct MTR input (fused_feature only enters via the aggregator path, now
dropped; the exported .npy features are loaded by the dataset but unused).
Cooperation enters through the DETECTIONS: WF intermediate fusion produces
the detections that form MTR's past trajectories. Paper framing: standard
MTR (with CMP's Swin lane-raster encoder) predicting from cooperatively
perceived trajectories — do NOT claim direct BEV-feature conditioning.
RATIONALE (agreed with Tyler 2026-07-08): sensing is multi-agent (~11
CAVs/zone feed WF fusion); prediction is single-agent BY ARCHITECTURE — the
edge is the one prediction point (the service model of the SEC/RELAY
papers). CMP's aggregator reconciles N per-vehicle predictors; our
architecture deliberately has one predictor, so the module answers a
question the system is designed not to have. Its stage-2 divergence is
secondary to this structural inapplicability.
**LIVE INTEGRATION DONE (2026-07-14): stage-1 MTR runs in the closed loop.**
Smoke on openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion_smoke (worldfusion_adaptive, WF
translaug_finetune net_epoch27 perception, stage-1 MTR): clean end-to-end
run, ZERO collisions, live delivered-prediction ADE 2.34 m @1 s /
2.1-2.5 m @2 s / 2.8-3.2 m @3 s, FDE 0.97-1.37 m, MR 24-32% (single
delivered mode on AB3DMOT tracks through the delivery pipeline; offline
minADE6 was 1.39 m). RELAY P0 is fully closed — live Q1/Q4/Q5/Q6 unblocked.
Wiring changes (all in repo):
- `mtr_edge_predictor.py`: valid=0 padding for short histories (training
  saw masked gaps, not frozen oldest-frame replicas); model 0.2 s steps
  resampled to 0.05 s sim ticks in _to_world (consumers index at tick rate;
  the OLD OPV2V wiring at 0.1 s had this mismatch silently); predictor owns
  lane-raster loading (`lane_map` arg).
- `ecav/core/map/rsu_lane_raster.py` (NEW): white-on-black 256x256 lane
  raster from MapManager HD-map geometry, training-raster convention;
  `lane_map: auto` in yaml renders it at manager init centered on
  world_anchor (rsu_manager_list is EMPTY at construction; anchor is the
  fusion frame anyway).
- Both MTR managers pass num_output_steps(100)/output_dt/lane_map;
  `worldfusion_mtr` registered as a named combination (naming rule: one
  name per pipeline combination — Tyler).
- `worldfusion_perception_manager.py`: camenc guard is now
  `getattr(...) is not None` (LiDAR-only ckpts set camenc=None; hasattr
  routed them into the camera branch and crashed).
- Smoke yaml: WF perception caronly_aug (scene-overfit) →
  translaug_finetune net_epoch27; mtr_predictor → stage-1 ckpt + no_agg cfg
  + new intention pkl, dataset multiv2x, aggregator 'None', time_interval
  0.2, history_subsample 4, lane_map auto (lane_range_m 90).
Follow-ups (not blockers): _run_mtr fired only once in the run
(amortization cache + mostly near-stopped traffic; fastest track at cadence
check 0.46 m/s) — rerun with the Tesla crossing at speed to exercise the
model harder; known live AB3DMOT ~9-tick fragmentation still pending as a
separate fix.

**Score-head calibration measured (2026-07-16, full test split, 1980
objects):** oracle minADE6 1.45 m / minFDE 2.69 m vs score-SELECTED mode
ADE 2.33 m / FDE 4.66 m. Argmax score picks the truly best mode 62.6% of
the time (best-or-2nd 79%; ranks r0:63 r1:16 r2:10 r3:6 r4:2 r5:3 %).
Selected-ADE median 1.18 m, p90 5.78 m — tail-heavy exactly where modes
diverge. CONSISTENCY: live delivered ADE (2.3-3.2 m @1-3 s) ≈ offline
selected-mode ADE (2.33 m) → the live pipeline adds ~no degradation; the
whole live-vs-oracle gap is mode selection. Paper: report minADE6 as
capability and selected-ADE as delivered. NOTE: futures are dense (90.2%
full 5 s, 95.3% mask density — GT-sourced), so truncation label noise is
minor; the gap is intrinsic multimodality + thin observed pasts.

**LIVE UNDER-PREDICTION ROOT CAUSE (2026-07-19, blind-overtake work).**
Blind overtake (openscenario_1_edge_worldfusion, Town01) exercised MTR on
real movers and exposed systematic under-prediction (12 m/s vehicle → 5.7 m
predicted @4.2 s; FDE 12-18 m, MR 83-100%). Diagnosis chain (all measured):
- Live inputs verified CORRECT ([MTR IN] instrumentation: world past and
  center-frame past both textbook).
- Synthetic constant-velocity probe: model under-predicts clean consecutive
  pasts at ALL speeds (3 m/s → 4.3 m; 12 m/s → 6.2 m @5 s) with full mode
  collapse; real test inputs predict movers fine (bucket eval: >25 m bucket
  minADE 3.56 m). Raster type and history depth: no effect on the probe.
- Real-sample full-mode dump: GT endpoint (-23,+13) BEHIND the stored
  center heading. Cause: dataset center heading = PRED pickle yaw = WF
  DETECTION yaw with 180° box ambiguity (~half of moving centers flipped).
  GT pickles themselves are 100% motion-aligned (measured).
- CONSEQUENCES: (1) the model hedges modes in BOTH directions (explains a
  chunk of the 62.6% top-1); (2) it infers motion from pasts calibrated on
  gappy/noisy detection pasts (44% recall); live feeds DENSE KF-smoothed
  AB3DMOT replay pasts = out of distribution → magnitude collapse.
  Neighbor-drop also halves magnitude (bisect) but live has neighbors.
- Train split is 62% parked centers (median 5 s displacement 0.4 m), test
  44%. Offline metrics honest for offline inputs; skew is train-vs-live.
FIX OPTIONS: (a) live-side, no retrain: feed per-frame detection positions
associated to tracks (gaps as invalid) instead of KF-smoothed replay —
reproduces the training generative process; (b) retrain with
tracker-generated pasts (train=live by construction); (+) normalize
detection yaw to motion direction offline+live to kill flip ambiguity.
Scenario work also done: Scenario_1.__init__ accepts vehicle_index /
distributed (was crashing scenario_runner); new openscenario_1_edge_worldfusion
yaml + runner; post-eval teardown core dump unexplained (non-blocking).
Two-locale split pending.

**BLIND OVERTAKE: DECISION CHAIN COMPLETE, EXECUTION 2 TICKS AWAY
(2026-08-02, runs 34-41).** Fix chain since the perception-bound note (each
verified by instrumented run):
- PREDICTION STARVATION (the deepest defect of the arc): the WF manager
  hard-cleared vm.agent.edge_predictions on every tick without a fresh 5 Hz
  delivery -> planner had NO predictions on ~75% of ticks (run 35 census:
  329 no-preds ticks). Oracle/late-fusion managers already deliver held
  stale copies; WF now does the same via _deliver_predictions (1 s cap).
  Run 38: no-preds 329 -> 12.
- Blocked-state detector: stationarity judged by 1 s TRACK displacement
  (velocity signals sit at the jitter floor); skip test for fragments with
  <0.6 s history; blocked counter is a symmetric +1/-1 leaky integrator
  (threshold 15) since lead visibility has a ~60% duty cycle.
- Overtake subject resolution: branch 9 resolves the same-lane blocking
  lead via _find_blocking_lead instead of trusting the braking-hazard
  target (which delivered cross-road prediction modes). Town01 map
  confirmed passable (Broken center marking; opposing-lane branch is the
  designed path). obstacle_speed NameError fixed. AB3DMOT birth counters
  getattr-guarded. 5 stale breakpoint() calls removed.
- Mode-sweep PAYOFF measured live (run 33+): [MODE SWEEP] catching
  conflicts from mode rank 1 that argmax would miss, in the occlusion
  scenario.
- Run 39/40: integrator crosses threshold, arming sustains, wait counter
  walks 18 -> 1..2, opposing-lane dry-run probes fire — SCENARIO ENDS 2
  ticks before commit: scenario_runner timeout 120 s WALL CLOCK shrinks
  sim duration as pipeline work grows. Watchdog now 360 s; MAX_STEPS 1100.
- Run 41 (the completion candidate): OOM twice — desktop session holds
  9.6 GB (Xorg leaked to 4.4 GB); machine structurally over budget while
  the session is up. WF model sharing already deduped (cav_world cache).
  PENDING TYLER: display restart vs idle-window runs.
- Teardown core dump: fires during interpreter finalize (native gRPC/carla
  threads), post-eval, cosmetic.
PLAN (Tyler): TWO eval scenarios — Jordan's right-merge multi-edge
(validated handoff harness; swap in WF+mamba+MTR stack = config work,
starts now) + blind overtake (safety-decision arm; single-locale 2 ticks
from done, then two-locale on the same pattern).

**SINGLE-RSU OVERTAKE: PERCEPTION-BOUND PLATEAU (2026-08-02, runs 12-16).**
Instrumented the association decision itself ([MAMBA LOST]: min IoU-cost,
BEV boxes, nearest det). Findings: 96% of Lost events have ZERO IoU with
EVERY detection; predicted boxes are sane (= last observation); the
vehicle's OWN detection is absent 4.5-21 m from the coasted track. Root
cause: WF per-vehicle mover recall in the Town01 approach is intermittent
(multi-frame gaps) INDEPENDENT of score threshold (0.10 override tried; the
dets are absent, not sub-threshold). Distance-based lost-recapture at 5 m
steals neighbors (dense traffic); 2 m + thresh 0.10 still fragments.
AB3DMOT's known ~9-tick live tracks were the SAME phenomenon.
CONCLUSION: the single-locale arm is at its perception bound. Fragmenting
~5 s mover tracks + hedged shallow-past predictions ARE the paper's
motivating baseline (fragmentary per-locale observation), causally
understood and quantified from these logs. The engineered remedy is the
TWO-LOCALE configuration (RSU-B over the approach at close range, warm
handoff to A) = the paper config. DECISION: freeze single-edge arm as the
Q1/Q4 baseline row; build two-locale on the validated Scenario B
(right_merge) harness; GT-injection arm for perception-isolated Q1 curves.
Tracker changes kept: center-distance lost-recapture (lost_match_dist_m,
default 5.0 — set 2.0 in yaml), score_threshold override hook in WF base
manager, all instrumentation (demote to debug after two-locale stabilizes).

**MAMBA GATE SEMANTICS FOUND (2026-08-01): match_thresh is a BEV
IoU-DISTANCE threshold in [0,1] (cost = 1 - IoU), association is
iou_distance_3d + Hungarian.** The multi-edge yaml's match_thresh 5.0 (and
my copied value, and the 2.5 attempt) SATURATE the gate: every pair passes, and
whenever the motion prediction misses its own box entirely all candidates
tie at cost 1.0 -> arbitrary assignment. Sparse scenes hide it (the only
overlapping pair is the right one); dense overtake traffic exposed it as
teleporting chimera tracks. AFFECTED: Scenario B / multi-edge mamba configs
(same 5.0), and the offline retrack (its tracks stayed clean via sparsity +
pruning, but the gate was saturated there too). Overtake run 8 with 0.9:
ZERO teleports across 43 tracks, movers smooth, FDE 6-9 m (from 11-45 +
km-scale). Remaining failure mode is FRAGMENTATION (motion model at 0.2 s
steps misses IoU -> Lost -> new id; 43 ids over ~10 vehicles). Next knobs:
0.95 gate (run 9 in flight), then per-tick stepping with empty-det
interleave in the mamba manager if needed. Once stable: re-retrack offline
at the SAME gate + retrain (parameter symmetry), fix scenario_3 smoke
yaml's history_subsample (same 0.8 s-past bug), and fix the multi-edge
yamls' saturated gates.

**LIVE MAMBA DEBUG CHAIN (2026-07-31).** Retrain 11527027 DONE: offline
minADE 2.31 m best (honest train=live metric; GT-anchored model's 1.39 m
was on easier keying). Ckpt at `ecav/ml_manager/models/mtr_wf_mamba/`.
Overtake yaml wired to worldfusion_mamba_adaptive + mamba ckpt. Merged
origin/develop (toolchain conflicts -> ours; his migration work -> theirs;
docs unioned; B4 warm/cold instrumentation kept from HEAD). Live-run fix
chain, each verified by rerun:
1. OOM at model load -> killed 61/79-day-old stale yolo_grpc_server
   daemons (~1 GB).
2. BeaconIdManager.remap_tracker_identity iterated AB3DMOT .trackers ->
   now tracker-agnostic (falls back to wrapper .tracker.tracked_tracklets).
3. kf_speed 462-936 m/s: wrapper memo-bank vel spans coasting intervals ->
   per-frame vel from previous EMITTED state.
4. Track teleport churn (65-97 jumps/track): callers pass sim ticks
   striding 4 as frame numbers -> wrapper keeps an INTERNAL per-call frame
   counter (offline counted 1/call; live must match). Result: 3 movers now
   physical (0.33 m/tick), first clean eval window (FDE 3.46 m, MR 0).
5. Residual churn on 2 tracklets + one 3 km FDE window -> match_thresh
   5.0 hops adjacent lanes (3-4 m spacing); overtake yaml now 2.5 (run 6
   in flight). If it holds, re-retrack offline at 2.5 + retrain for
   parameter consistency.
All cid=-1 live is EXPECTED (scenario NPCs never beacon; develop's
position-fallback export exists for this).

**MAMBA3DMOT SWITCH IN FLIGHT (2026-07-21..27).** Decision (Tyler): the
WF+MTR pipeline runs on mamba3dmot end to end — AB3DMOT was lineage, not
choice; RELAY migrates MambaTrack state, so tracker must be mamba both
offline and live (train=live by construction).
DONE:
- `retrack_pred_with_mamba.py`: decodes detections from SAVED fused
  features (heads only, no WF re-run; saved features are post-shrink and
  heads apply directly), runs Mamba3DMOTWrapper per zone (live-tuned cfg:
  match_thresh 5.0, max_time_lost 60), tracks->GT keying by gated Hungarian
  + lifetime majority vote (min 3), prunes misattributed segments (>2x gate
  from keyed GT when visible; >6 m/frame jumps) — id-reuse stitching caused
  137 m teleports before pruning. Yaw normalized to motion direction
  (kills detection 180° flip). All 52 zones: 103k train / 2k test states,
  max step 6.0 m. Old GT-anchored pickles kept for ablation.
- Loader: `PRED_TRAJ_DIRNAME` cfg key; `_no_agg_mamba.yaml` variant.
- RETRAIN job 11527027 queued (4x H200, stage-1 only,
  `mtr_wf_stage1_mamba.sbatch`: big tar + small `wf_mtr_pred_mamba.tar`
  overlay; 11 MB pred tar uploaded, code tar refreshed).
- LIVE: predictor normalizes input yaw to motion direction (same rule);
  Mamba3DMOTWrapper row layout FIXED to AB3DMOT-consumer convention
  (carla_id col 8, vx/vy cols 10/12 — was frame at 8/carla at 10, so the
  B0 multi-edge mamba runs stamped carla_id=frame and garbage kf_speed;
  latent-export via tracked_tracklets was unaffected);
  WF base manager grew `_format_dets_for_tracker` / `_track_row_to_box`
  hooks (+hasattr-guarded AB3DMOT debug);
  NEW `WorldFusionMambaAdaptiveEdge` (edge_manager_worldfusion_mamba_mtr.py,
  registry WORLDFUSION_MAMBA_ADAPTIVE / _MTR): feeds tracker PLAIN-axis
  dets (un-swaps the WF KITTI swap — offline retrack used plain axes, live
  must match) and parses plain rows on replay.
NEXT: retrain lands -> pull ckpt -> blind-overtake yaml to
worldfusion_mamba_adaptive + new ckpt -> rerun -> two-locale split.

**Mode-sweep planner SHIPPED (2026-07-19).** behavior_agent.py's collision
loop now sweeps the top-K prediction modes by score (K =
`prediction_mode_top_k` in behavior yaml, default 2 = 79% best-mode
coverage; 6 = full Autoware-style sweep, 1 = argmax ablation) and acts on
the earliest conflicting TTC; drawing re-run uses the conflicting mode.
Falls back to the single trajectory for non-multimodal predictors
(linear/SMART). Precedent: Apollo builds ST boundaries per predicted
trajectory; Autoware obstacle_cruise iterates predicted_paths by
confidence. NO proto change needed for current runs: distributed:false is
in-process, ObstaclePrediction objects carry predicted_trajectories_all +
mode_scores end to end (ecloud.proto GeneratedTrajectory has only the
single trajectory — extend it IF distributed vehicle-side planning is ever
used). Validation smoke (run 5): exit 0, no tracebacks, FDE 0.77-1.20 m /
MR 17-23% (same band as argmax run), 0 ghost brakes. The mode-divergence
payoff case (fast crosser) is the pending fast-Tesla rerun.

**Prior run details (10804312, infra reference):** (8x H200, 12 h limit).
`mtr_wf_ddp_8gpu.sbatch` rewritten for the CMP recipe: stage 1 `_no_agg` 30
epochs (extra_tag wf_stage1) → stage 2 Transformer aggregator 30 epochs
initialized from stage-1 best_model (lowest eval MR; falls back to newest
epoch ckpt). Output layout is `output/<TAG>/<extra_tag>/ckpt/` (NO
EXP_GROUP_PATH); yaml PRETRAINED path fixed accordingly. EXIT trap copies
output back to `$PROJECT/mtr_wf_runs/<jobid>/` (node NVMe is wiped), plus an
explicit copy between stages. ~10 min/epoch at 2 GPUs → 8 GPUs ≈ 2.5 min/epoch;
both stages plus untar fit well inside 12 h.

**Local artifacts:** prior full export (caronly_aug, WRONG model) at
`models/multiv2x_mtr_wf/` (174GB, regenerate with translaug). PACE dataset
intact: `$SCRATCH/Multi-V2X.tar` (plain tar), env `$PROJECT/miniconda3/envs/opencda310`.

## Merged origin/develop into paper-closed-loop-recreate (2026-06-17)

Brought develop's edge-only distributed mode work onto this branch (PR #18,
tlandle/eCAV develop). Conflicts resolved in: `.gitignore` (union), this file
(kept this branch's state), `edge_manager_prediction_late_fusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py`
(kept both method sets: our `_advance_actors` + conflict-kinematics logging AND
develop's `collect_features`/`apply_predictions` edge-only collect/apply split), and
`migration/payload.py`. The payload merge is the substantive one: `TrackLatent` now
supports BOTH tracker backends. MambaTrack populates `memo_bank`/`diff_memo_bank` +
bbox + bookkeeping (our migration harness path); AB3DMOT populates `kf_state`
(develop's `KFState` Kalman snapshot, used by `edge_manager_pluggable_base`
export/import). All backend-specific fields default so either construction site is
valid. develop also adds `migration/{daemon,link}.py` (production handoff daemon +
inter-locale link cost model) alongside our `factories.py`/`harness.py`. The in-sim
migration is a model (pickle + bandwidth/latency); a real deployment would carry the
same per-track state over a real protocol.

## Multi-Edge Predictive Latent Migration — harness + Kalman baseline (2026-06-15)

Paper is SUBMITTED (safety_envelope_sensys). Back on the multi-edge / cross-edge
handoff line (Paper 2/3 "Scale-Out"). The 2026-04-18 plan said "not started"; it is now
well underway. `ecav/core/application/edge/migration/` has: locale registry + binding +
payload + `harness.py` (synthetic warm-handoff validation) + live Mamba3DMOT latent
transfer. Commits 70cd4ae8 (registry/binding/payload/smoke) -> 3bd09544 (live latent
transfer) -> 09ad5c41 (turn/brake/lane-change traces + frame-aligned 5-frame gap metric).

**Harness now runs a THREE-WAY comparison** (this session, factories.py + harness.py,
uncommitted): full-latent migration **B** (ours, full memo/diff history) vs Reactive-Kalman
**B1** (`history_depth=1`, migrate only the latest bbox+diff) vs cold-start **B0** (no
migration). `factories.latent_from_tracklet` got a `history_depth` knob (truncates the
migrated banks); `_summary_row` + the table + CHECK 3 report all three.

RESULT (handoff_frame=10, total=30, synthetic 1-vehicle trace, device=cuda), metres:

| traj        | 5f full | 5f Kalman | 5f cold | mean full | mean Kal | mean cold | B/B1 bytes |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| straight    | 0.027   | 0.205     | 0.250   | 0.026     | 0.070    | 0.072     | 1302/805   |
| turn        | 0.068   | 0.245     | 0.275   | 0.185     | 0.229    | 0.235     | 1302/805   |
| brake       | 0.079   | 0.221     | 0.255   | 0.116     | 0.147    | 0.147     | 1302/805   |
| lane_change | 0.047   | 0.231     | 0.265   | 0.055     | 0.102    | 0.102     | 1302/805   |

FINDING: full-latent migration is ~3-5x lower error than Kalman/cold in the 5-frame
post-handoff window; **Kalman single-frame ~= cold** (the Mamba SSM predictive state is not
reconstructable from one frame, so a KF-style warm handoff barely helps). Overall means
converge as all destinations re-accumulate history -> the gap window IS the handoff cost.
Full history costs only ~1.6x the payload. CHECK 1 (state parity byte-equal) + CHECK 2
(prediction parity 0.0) still pass.

CAVEATS: synthetic harness, idealized detection trace (no detection noise); the "Kalman"
baseline is APPROXIMATED by truncating the Mamba memo bank to 1 frame, not a real KF.
NEXT options: vary handoff_frame / longer traces / detection noise; or move from the
synthetic harness to a real multi-edge CARLA locale-boundary crossing. Run:
`conda activate opencda310; python -m ecav.core.application.edge.migration.harness [--quiet]`.

## Paper (safety_envelope_sensys, standalone repo on github.com/tlandle) — 2026-06-05

Terminology standardization pass landed on `master` (c352280, Overleaf-synced). One term
per concept, enforced paper-wide across active files (abstract, introduction, related_work,
system_architecture, evaluation4, discussion, conclusion + the floats eval4 inputs):
**object sharing** (architecture umbrella) / **object list** (payload) / **V2X2V prediction**
(evaluated instance, in figs+Table 2) / **age at use** + **tail age at use** (not AoI/freshness/
tail latency) / **merge point** (not publish/fusion/consumer boundary) / **planner boundary** /
**physics boundary** + **logic boundary** (not limit/cliff/mass/penalty) / **self-ghost** /
**spatial self-filtering**. "Late Fusion" removed from the main eval. Figure generator
`scripts/arch_envelope_pipeline.py` ARCH labels already match ("I2V object sharing",
"V2X2V prediction"); no re-render needed. Conclusion rewritten to current paper (up to 32
CAVs, situation-dependent budget ~220-450ms, four claims, safety margin m(a,u,N)). Discussion
significantly shortened: redundant-with-eval and stale-N=16 paragraphs commented out (not
deleted) per comment-out policy. Compiles clean, 14 pages.

STILL PENDING (deferred, not in the last two requests): §3 BLOCK-2 edits (maneuver-qualifier
F_u/tau_max paragraph, §3 margin definition, §3 intermediate-fusion-as-perception sentence,
move the "We instrument the pipeline" paragraph to §5.1). Inactive files (evaluation2/3,
appendix, old floats) were reverted to keep the commit scoped; they keep legacy terminology
and need a full pass only if reactivated.

## BLOCKER: edge never delivers a moving prediction; ego collides at ALL latencies (2026-06-01)

Branch `paper-closed-loop-recreate`. Scenario `openscenario_3_edge_late_fusion_boundary`,
TD via `CROSS_TRIGGER_DIST`, run under conda env `opencda310`.

THE conflict_kinematics `collision_flag` IS DEAD. It reports 0 even during a real
collision. The true collision signal is `simulation_metrics.json: focal_collisions`
(and `collision_count`, the per-tick CARLA sensor). All prior "no collision at any
latency / predictor compensates" conclusions were artifacts of reading that dead flag.

REAL collision data (focal_collisions): TD=68 collides at lat 0/100/200/300/450
(ALL, incl zero). TD=69 collides at NONE (Tesla physically clears ~10-12 ticks before
ego regardless of perception). So there is no latency cliff: at TD=68 the ego fails
to avoid even with perfectly fresh data; at TD=69 there is no conflict. Latency was
never the operative variable.

ROOT CAUSE (airtight, lat0 TD=68 run 20260601_215049):
- The edge AB3DMOT tracker cannot hold a continuous track on the moving cross-traffic.
  The Tesla is on the `[TRACKS]` path (125<=y<=131, x<=-40) in only 41/212 frames (19%),
  across 7 distinct track ids (27,71,107,130,148,203,207). 81% of frames it is not
  tracked at all. Only the STATIONARY occluders hold age-30 tracks.
- Predictor is the LINEAR predictor (confirmed in log), so no history requirement; the
  problem is that the moving track mostly does not exist. `[PREDS]` therefore contains
  only stationary occluder tracks (max speed ever in any pred = 0.7 m/s).
- Ego `edge_preds_received_total: 0`, `edge_ticks_with_preds: 0`. RSS proper-response
  (behavior_agent.py:1437) only fires on a predicted collision, so it NEVER fires
  (0 `[RSS]` lines). Ego only reacts via its own YOLO at ~8m (brake at tick 116), can't
  stop from 10 m/s, collides ~tick 122-123 (Tesla speed collapses 13->5).

ROOT CAUSE PINNED (DET_TRACE instrumentation): detection is NOT the problem. The Tesla
is detected on the path every tick (clean smooth centers, DET_TRACE). The failure is
AB3DMOT association: KITTI/pvrcnn Car uses giou_3d (thres -0.2), but the roadside
camera-lidar fusion (o3d_lidar_libs.py:251 get_axis_aligned_bounding_box of near-face
points, >=2 pts) produces degenerate boxes (sliver widths 0.4-1.0m, oscillating, axis-
aligned so yaw~0). GIoU between KF-predicted and detection box collapses below -0.2 even
though centers are clean -> track fragments (19% tracked, 7 IDs). Anchoring birth-
suppression ruled out (counters suppressed=0, cull=0 during approach). Kinematic gate
ruled out (rejects only stationary occluders, never the fast Tesla).

FIX APPLIED (measurement-model alignment, per advisor):
1. AB3DMOT_libs/model.py get_param KITTI/pvrcnn Car: giou_3d -> dist_2d (BEV center /
   kinematic association), thres 4 (4 m gate). Matches the reliable part of the
   measurement; the existing kinematic innovation gate provides the velocity residual.
2. edge_manager_..._linear_predictor.py _collect_ab3d_detections: clamp anonymous
   vehicle-det extents [h,w,l] to a class car prior (1.2-2.0, 1.6-2.4, 3.5-5.5) so
   unstable extent is not trusted and the downstream footprint is a real car.
3. NMS gate 3.0->3.5, mot_cfg min_hits 3->2 (testing) for the cross-source duplicate.

RESULTS so far (lat0 TD=68): collision went from 5/5 always -> 3/5 (run_3 fully avoided);
RSS now FIRES (0 -> 6); contact 68 -> 5 hits; track continuity 19% -> 60%. Residual: the
Tesla yields TWO detections ~3.2 m apart almost every tick (RSU1+RSU2), oscillating 1<->2,
which churns the track (16 IDs) so RSS fires slightly late and the ego grazes 3/5. This is
a cross-agent detection-fusion (multi-view duplicate) problem. Testing NMS=3.5 + min_hits=2
over 5 reps. Naive NMS=4.5 over-merged (all metrics worse) so do NOT just widen the gate.

RESOLUTION DIRECTION: stop chasing the perception/tracker quality on YOLO+lidar boxes.
The NMS / min_hits / center-fusion tuning did NOT converge (collision rate bounced 3-5/5,
within closed-loop noise). The clean path is the ORACLE DETECTOR.

ORACLE-DETECTOR REAL RESULT (2026-06-02, mgr=oracle = GT boxes + AB3DMOT + linear
predictor + cooperative prediction, TD=68, 3 reps): MEASURED reference physics envelope
P[S_op] = 1.00 at lat 0/100/200/300 and 0.00 at lat 450 (3/3 collide). DETERMINISTIC
(zero rep noise) because the tracker no longer churns. So the architecture works when
detection is clean; the whole blocker was perception box quality. Real latency cliff lies
between 300 and 450 ms. Run dir 20260602_191819.

ARCHITECTURE-COMPARISON INFRASTRUCTURE ADDED: a `DETECTOR=oracle` env toggle now runs any
infra/cip manager on GT detections.
- late_fusion: new `_collect_detections_for_frame()` dispatch method in run_step (default
  = perception + cross-source NMS).
- InfraOnly: `self.detector` (env DETECTOR or cfg); when oracle, update_information pushes
  GT actors and the dispatch uses `_collect_oracle_detections`. CIP inherits both.
- `_collect_oracle_detections` made robust to empty beacons (infra-only: ego appears as an
  anonymous GT detection). Files: edge_manager_{prediction_late_fusion,infra_only,oracle}.

NEXT: sweep `oracle` (coop prediction), `infra_only`+DETECTOR=oracle (I2V perception),
`cip`+DETECTOR=oracle (cooperative planning) over latency on the SAME GT detections ->
real per-architecture envelopes (perception vs prediction vs planning), no perception
confound. Add 350/400 ms to resolve the 300-450 cliff. These are the real measured per-architecture envelopes.

Process notes: env is `opencda310` (conda root /home/atlas/anaconda3). Latency sweep
warmup intentionally shifts whole scenario ~2 ticks/100ms (ego+cross stay in sync; do
NOT replace the proximity trigger with fixed-sim-time). Foreground `sleep` is blocked by
the harness; run CARLA/sweeps as background tasks.

## PROVENANCE-HISTORY TAXONOMY for brake classification (2026-05-31)

The "self-ghost" metric was OVER-LABELING. Traced end-to-end: track 59 born
tracking the crossing Tesla (-79->-81 moving), then FROZE at (-83.5,127.4) ~30
ticks, fed by a MIX of Tesla + ego/RSU detections at the conflict point. It is a
track-merge / frozen-phantom, NOT an ego self-echo. nearest-ego-NOW labeled it
self_ghost because the ego drives through that frozen point.

FIX (per Alex/prof): classify a brake-triggering track by PROVENANCE HISTORY, not
nearest-ego-now. Implemented:
- late_fusion `_ab3d_history_to_trajs`: each tick, GT-match every live track's
  position to nearest actor; append ('ego'|'nonego',id,dist) to
  self._track_provenance[track_id] (deque maxlen 15).
- `_label_brake_attributions_gt`: read the triggering track's provenance hist:
    consistently ego, no non-ego -> self_ghost (true ego echo)
    ego AND non-ego present       -> track_merge (re-match to non-ego for FP/TP)
    consistently non-ego          -> external_stale
    no history                    -> fall back to nearest-now
  Stored on attr['gt_provenance_class'].

CONFIRMED WORKING (taxonomy2, lat-100 anchoring-on): the 7 brake events that were
mislabeled self_ghost are ALL prov=track_merge (ego_ticks 2-8, nonego_ticks 7-13;
each track's history dominated by the Tesla with a few ego ticks at the end). All
7 correctly reclassified OFF self_ghost. So the lat-100 "SBA leak" was 100%
track-merge contamination, NOT a real self-ghost and NOT an SBA failure.

Re-running 10-rep LF on/off sweep (validate_tax, lat 0/100/200/300/450) with the
fixed taxonomy to check P[S_op] monotonicity + SBA separation on the corrected
self_ghost metric. Then prof safety-critical check #4. ~40s/run.

4-class taxonomy: self_ghost / track_merge_identity_switch / external_stale /
other_fp.

SAFETY-CRITICAL CHECK still owed (prof #4): when SBA suppresses an ego-consistent
track at the conflict, confirm the real cross-traffic Tesla stays tracked
elsewhere and in the planner collision set, else SBA could hide a real obstacle.

POSSIBLE REFRAME (prof): if corrected taxonomy shows many early failures are
track_merge not self_ghost, shift the claim from "self-ghosting" to
"edge-published identity ambiguity" (self-ghost is ONE instance). Closer to the
MobiCom critique, less brittle.

PRIORITY (prof): fix taxonomy BEFORE adding baselines. Repro 20260419 IS clean on
self-ghost (SBA-off 0->4 episodes, SBA-on ~0) with the ORIGINAL classifier on the
SAME scenario (LTAP/OD = scenario_3); our contamination came from run dynamics
(our ego ~7.7 m/s vs repro ~3.6 m/s through the conflict), making the ego reach
the frozen-track overlap point.

## FAILURE-ATTRIBUTION FRAMING + EGO-PROVENANCE SELF-GHOST GATE (2026-05-31)

Tyler's framing (governing for the eval): scenario failure MUST be attributed
with high confidence, separating SELF-GHOST false-brakes from OTHER artifacts.
- Self-ghosting = ego brakes for its OWN republished stale track. Significant,
  distinct failure class. Happens at a distance delta that scales with latency
  and ego speed. SBA REMOVES this class (and only this class).
- Source of self-ghosting = MULTI-SOURCE DISAGREEMENT, inherent to ANY
  object-level fusion (RSU-side, multi-vehicle detection, any detection
  combining). Ironically the same disagreement also drives the OTHER false
  brakes. Open tension: may imply object-based late fusion is fundamentally
  fragile; SBA fixes self-ghosting specifically, not the rest.
- DATA MUST look as clean as the paper figures.

Do NOT try to attribute a stale/spurious track to some "real" GT actor (ill-
posed; the track may correspond to nothing). The ONLY high-confidence question
is binary: IS this track the EGO'S OWN echo or not? Answerable exactly because
the ego's GT trajectory is known.

EGO-PROVENANCE GATE (implemented in _label_brake_attributions_gt): a brake is
self_ghost ONLY if (a) nearest GT actor now is the ego AND (b) the ego was
actually at the track's position at the track's SOURCE_TICK (within 3m, from
_gt_snapshots[source_tick][ego_id]). If the ego was elsewhere then (e.g. still
approaching while a stale CROSS-TRAFFIC track sits at the conflict the ego later
drives through), it is NOT a self-ghost -> re-matched to nearest NON-ego actor
and classified as hazard/other_fp. This stops the stale-Tesla mislabel that
corrupted P[S_op]. Logged as [GHOST-RECLASS]. Uses only the ego's own GT path,
no phantom-actor attribution. Validation run in progress.

REVERTED: the source-tick / trajectory-window matcher experiments (over-
engineered, attributing bunk tracks to maybe-nonexistent actors). Matcher is
back to original nearest-now; the ego-provenance GATE is the only addition.

## THE lat-100 "SELF-GHOST" IS A GT-MATCHER MISLABEL, NOT SBA (2026-05-31)

PROVEN with GHOST_DEBUG=1 ([GHOST-MATCH] dump in _label_brake_attributions_gt).
The lat-100 anchoring-ON "self-ghost" that dropped P[S_op] to ~0.56:
- ghost track 58 is FROZEN at (-83.5,127.4), on the cross-traffic Tesla's path.
- the LIVE Tesla (id655) has already moved WEST to -88..-95 at 13.x m/s (past the
  conflict); the track is stale, lagging the real Tesla by 5-12m (100ms latency +
  tracker coast).
- matcher position-matches the STALE track pos to nearest GT actor. Tesla moved
  away so it's not nearest; the EGO (id654), arriving at the conflict, is nearest
  (d~0.9m) -> labeled self_ghost -> matched GT actor = ego.

So it is NOT an ego self-echo and NOT an SBA leak. SBA is WORKING. It is a GT
brake-CLASSIFIER bug: a stale anonymous cross-traffic track gets called
self_ghost whenever the ego coincides with the track's STALE position while the
real source actor has driven away. A cross-traffic Tesla can never be a real
self-ghost (Tyler's objection, correct).

CONSEQUENCE: the s_op envelope was corrupted, counting stale-real-obstacle brakes
(an AoI/physics effect) as self_ghost (logic). This is why P[S_op] looked low/
jumpy for anchoring-ON. Fix is in the CLASSIFIER, not SBA: match a stale track to
the actor whose TRAJECTORY passed through its position (the Tesla), classify as
true-positive / stale-true-obstacle, not self_ghost. My earlier "SBA leaks at
1.16m / swept-path doesn't fire" conclusion was WRONG (I read EGO-SUPPRESS from a
different tick + a passing run). SBA footprint suppression fires correctly at the
ghost ticks.

SEPARATE open question (Tyler): does the occluder column (x=-81, y<=119, SOUTH of
conflict) actually occlude the EAST-WEST cross-traffic at the conflict? If not,
the "blind intersection" premise may be weak. Check scenario occlusion integrity.

## REAL REPRO DATA FOUND: 20 reps is what makes S_op monotone (2026-05-31)

The actual paper repro data is `safety_envelope_paper/experiment_results/20260419_120000`
(Tyler pointed me there; NOT the 20260311_230618 the plot-script default points
at, which is undersized). It has 4800 run dirs: mgr {lf,oracle,vips} x anchoring
{on,off} x lat {0-550/50} x ego {1,4} x scenario {ltap_od, scp} x ~20 reps/cell.

P[S_op=1] vs configured latency from THIS data (ltap_od, ego1, 20 reps/cell) is
CLEAN and matches the paper claim:
  lf/off:  1.0 .75 .38 .20 .05 .10 0 ...        sharp cliff ~100-150ms
  lf/on:   1.0 1.0 .93 1.0 .85 .65 .80 .55 .07  holds, cliff ~400ms
  oracle:  1.0 1.0 .95 .85 .90 .95 .95 .70 .17  physics floor ~400ms
  vips/off:1.0 .90 .35 .40 .10 0 ...            cliff like lf/off
  vips/on: 1.0 1.0 .97 .90 .72 1.0 .80 .70 .07  holds like lf/on
SBA expands envelope from ~100ms logic cliff to ~400ms physics limit. Confirmed.

ROOT CAUSE of my non-monotonic S_op: I had 3-5 reps; S_op is a binary AND
dominated by a flickering 1-2 ghost-episode count, so per-config P was 0/1 noise.
At 20 reps P[S_op=1] is a real probability and near-monotone (tiny wiggle that
AoI-binning / cumulative-min smooths). The fix is REP COUNT, not the metric.

CONSEQUENCE: the full matrix must be ~20 reps/cell (I launched 5 -> killed it,
correct call). This resizes the matrix a lot (20 reps x 2 scenarios x ego counts).
New arms (1-RSU, 2-RSU, CIP, local-only) must match 20-rep density. Also the
repro covers 2 scenarios (ltap_od, scp) and ego {1,4} -- richer than my single
ltap/40km-h smoke. GATE: reproduce the published sop_vs_aoi from 20260419_120000
before committing the full new-arm matrix.

## FULL MATRIX LAUNCHED (5 clean arms) + CIP/ns-3/framing (2026-05-31)

**Full controlled-latency matrix RUNNING** (task bw1tno35p, log /tmp/full_matrix.log,
~330 runs matrix A + ~110 B/C, ~20h+). Arms: late_fusion + oracle + vips_temporal
(anchoring both) + infra_only 1-RSU + infra_only 2-RSU. Latencies 0-500/50ms, 5
reps, 40 km/h, conflict logger on, CONTROLLED latency (ns-3 OFF by default).
Verify with scripts/verify_sweep_run.py + paper1_real_aligned_plots.py.

**Shakedown verified 5/6 arms clean** (recall>0, AoI tracks latency, euniq smooth).
Headline gradient (euniq, no vehicle uplink): Oracle 0.00 < 1-RSU 0.05 < 2-RSU
0.16 < LF 0.28. Source-count drives ego-uniqueness violations = the reviewer
answer (self-ghosting is multi-source, not V2X2V).

**CIP off critical path, diagnosed.** Fixed: apply_control tuple bug (now via
vm.controller) + zero-DL (now DL-delayed command delivery). Remaining: CIP's
_advance_actors override is incomplete (calls agent.update_information with empty
objects, bypasses vm.update_info -> no map/route update -> planner stalls ->
0.08 m/s, 234 collisions). Fix scoped in full_envelope_matrix.md; parallel work.

**ns-3 LUT = SECONDARY validation only, not matrix default** (Tyler). Don't change
two variables at once. Matrix = controlled latency. ns-3 Uu LUT (payload/N-aware,
UL+DL) is a separate scatter (fix architecture, vary network) showing realistic
radio maps to the same measured-Delta_use envelope. SEE-V2X trace is PC5 sidelink
(t1->rsu), NOT unicast DL, so CIP's command DL must use ns-3 DL LUT or controlled
latency, never the sidelink trace. ns3_lut_sampler wired into late_fusion family
(use_ns3_lut, default False) + CIP DL.

**FRAMING (governing): "how much CP is usable"** not "we found self-ghosting".
3 gates: info-value (d_coop-eps>d_los), physics (M>=0), consistency (identity).
Main plot = usable region, CP gain = S_op(edge) - S_op(local-only). REQUIRES a
LOCAL-ONLY arm (VehicleSideTracker, no edge pred) = NOT yet configured, parallel
work. safety_envelope.py has margin/Delta*/classify already.

## SMOOTH AoI REQUIRES THE SEE-V2X TRACE, NOT FIXED LATENCY (2026-05-31)

The stairstep AoI (vs the paper's smooth CDF) is because my smoke sweeps used
fixed `latency` + `jitter_std=0`: AoI-at-use collapses to one tick value per
setpoint (lat200 -> hist [34@4t,179@5t,2@6t], p50=p95=p99=5t). The paper's smooth
AoI comes from the HybridModel sampling the SEE-V2X C-V2X RTT trace per packet
(`data/see_v2x/merged_latency.csv`, 213k samples, latency_ms median 14.3 / p5 6.4
/ p95 23.1) + backhaul lognormal. So the FULL MATRIX must run with
`--see-v2x-trace data/see_v2x/merged_latency.csv`; --latencies sets the hybrid
base_ms offset and the trace adds realistic jitter. Shakedown (fixed latency) is
fine for validating arms RUN; final data uses the trace. Tyler caught this.

## THE CLEAN-DATA PIPELINE: episodes via compute_run_metrics (2026-05-31)

Resolved how the paper gets clean (non-binary) data. The reproduction sweep is
`ecav/scenario_testing/evaluation_outputs/20260311_230618` (100 run dirs). The
plot scripts `scripts/paper1_real_data_plots.py` / `paper1_real_aligned_plots.py`
load it through `scripts/recompute_metrics.py::compute_run_metrics`, which:
  - counts brake EPISODES via `_count_episodes` (contiguous same-track_id ticks,
    gap<=2, collapse to ONE episode), not raw per-tick brake counts;
  - derives focal_ghost_episodes / focal_fp_episodes / focal_tp_episodes,
    focal_*_ticks, s_op, plus continuous AoI + ego_uniqueness from edges{}.

My "7-8 ghosts at lat100" was 8 TICKS of ONE persistent stale-echo track =
1 EPISODE. Reporting raw ticks inflated it and made it look jumpy/binary.

My 40km/h sweep re-read via compute_run_metrics (EPISODES, clean):
  ghost_eps  lat: 0    100  200  300  400
  OFF             11.0  2.5  0.0  1.0  1.0
  ON               0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
Headline SBA result is clean: lat0 OFF 11 ghost-episodes -> ON 0. lat100 ON has
1 residual episode (the lone artifact point); everywhere else ON=0.

RULE: ALL analysis/figures go through scripts/recompute_metrics.compute_run_metrics
(episodes + continuous AoI/ego-uniqueness), matching the paper pipeline. Never
report raw total_ghost_brake_gt / per-tick counts as the primary number.

## METRIC CORRECTION: Use Continuous Envelope Fields, Not Binary Counts (2026-05-31)

Major correction. The existing paper plots (scripts/paper1_real_*_plots.py) are
built on CONTINUOUS / distributional metrics, NOT binary flags:
  - AoI: aoi_mean/p50/p95/p99_ticks, aoi_hist_counts, aoi_cdf  (the x-axis spine)
  - ego_uniqueness_violation_tick_fraction, ego_uniqueness_total_duplicate_tracks
  - prediction_fde_m, prediction_miss_rate, detection_recall/precision/f1
  - timing_p95/p99_ms, tracking_avg_mota/idf1
All live in the per-run simulation_metrics.json `edges{}` entry (~50 continuous
fields) and per-vehicle `vehicles{}` (avg_ttc_s, avg_speed_mps, ...).

I had been reporting the COARSEST binary fields (s_op 0/1, collision_count,
raw integer total_ghost_brake_gt). Those flicker and look non-monotonic. Read
through the continuous fields instead, the same sweep is SMOOTH:

ego_uniqueness_violation_tick_fraction over lat 0/100/200/300/400 (40km/h smoke):
  OFF: 0.284, 0.261, 0.299, 0.271, 0.253
  ON : 0.261, 0.276, 0.310, 0.283, 0.265
duplicate_tracks OFF 119-126, ON 105-132. FDE ~3.4-4.8m. NO 100ms spike.

So the "100ms anomaly" was largely an artifact of reading the binary
total_ghost_brake_gt (a jumpy low integer), not the data. The continuous
ego-uniqueness fraction is smooth across all latencies. The SBA on/off effect in
the continuous metric is MODEST and continuous (dup_tracks 105 vs 119 at lat0),
not the binary "11 vs 0" I reported off the brake count.

OPEN: edge metric ego_uniqueness_total_ego_ghost_tracks=0 everywhere, but
planner-side total_ghost_brake_gt showed 7-8 at lat100. Two different ghost
measures (edge duplicate-ego-track detection vs planner GT-labeled self-ghost
brake) that disagree; reconcile which is the reportable one.

NOTE my session runs HAVE the full aoi_*_ticks distribution; the older Feb clean
suite does NOT (fields added later). So my data is richer on the AoI axis, it
just needs to be read/plotted via the continuous fields like the paper does.

ACTION: all new analysis + figures use the continuous edge/vehicle fields and AoI
distributions, not s_op/collision_count/raw ghost counts as the primary axis.

## 100ms Anomaly = Numerical Artifact + SBA Suppression Safety Check (2026-05-31)

**100ms spike RESOLVED as a numerical knife-edge artifact, NOT a real effect.**
Diagnostic ON-arm latency sweep (50/100/150/250ms, results under
`experiment_results/.../20260531_002249`) combined with the prior sweep gives the
full shape: GT self-ghosts = {0:0, 50:0, 100:[1 here / 7-8 prior], 150:0, 200:0,
250:0, 300:0, 400:0}. Robustly zero at every latency except an UNSTABLE single
point at 100ms whose magnitude is non-reproducible (1 vs 7-8 across reps). A real
AoI/SBA effect would be stable and smooth; a razor-thin non-reproducible spike at
one latency is timing/track-association metastability at that specific state-age.
Treat as a known artifact (exclude with footnote or average over many reps).
SBA's conclusion stands. Tyler's call: it's the scenario/config, not the idea.

**SBA suppression has a real robustness gap (independent of the artifact).** For
an anonymous track within self_id_radius=5m of the ego, suppression needs either
footprint overlap (tight box: ego extent + 1.2m long / 1.0m lat) OR speed-match.
A stale stationary ego-echo at 1-2.4m falls between both (outside the ~2m box,
stationary so speed-gate rejects). That gap is why the 100ms point is metastable.

**SAFETY CONSTRAINT (Tyler):** the fix must NOT blind the ego to pedestrians,
cyclists, slow vehicles, or stopped vehicles near it. This is live, not
hypothetical: the occluder column sits at x=-81 and the ego passes at x=-84.5,
only 3.5m away, INSIDE a 5m self_id_radius. scenario_3 also has 2 pedestrians.
So radius-based suppression is unsafe; suppression must key on ego-IDENTITY
provenance (beacon-forward prediction so stale echoes get ID-stamped, or
swept-path match against the ego's own recent trajectory), never spatial
proximity alone. Beacon-forward is safest: it only ever suppresses tracks
carrying the ego's own beacon, so VRUs (no beacon) are structurally immune.

**Instrumentation added** (`edge_manager_prediction_late_fusion...py`):
`[SUPP-REAL-OBSTACLE]` warning at both suppression paths (footprint + speed-gate)
that GT-cross-checks each suppressed track; if its nearest GT actor is NOT the
ego, it logged a real-obstacle suppression (a bug). Makes "SBA never erases a
real obstacle" measurable. NOTE the prior sweep showed footprint=2 suppressions
with stat_candidates=3 while the ego was near the occluder column, which is why
this check matters. Safety-check run in progress to see if any fire.

## AoI Cliff Sweep @40km/h + SBA AoI Blind Spot (2026-05-31)

LF AoI sweep, late_fusion smoke, 40 km/h, latencies 0/100/200/300/400ms,
anchoring on/off, 2 reps (`experiment_results/.../20260530_225452`). Per-tick
conflict logger on. Results (ghost = GT self-ghost brakes, raw both reps):

| anc | lat | coll | ghost | S_op |
|-----|-----|------|-------|------|
| OFF | 0   | 0 | [11,11] | 0 |
| OFF | 100 | 0 | [7,8]   | 0 |
| OFF | 200 | 0 | [0,0]   | 1 |
| OFF | 300 | 0 | [1,1]   | 0 |
| OFF | 400 | 0 | [4,4]   | 0 |
| ON  | 0   | 0 | [0,0]   | 1 |
| ON  | 100 | 0 | [7,8]   | 0 |
| ON  | 200 | 0 | [0,0]   | 1 |
| ON  | 300 | 0 | [0,0]   | 1 |
| ON  | 400 | 0 | [0,0]   | 1 |

**Clean results:** (1) SBA removes self-ghosting at lat 0 (OFF=11 -> ON=0) and
at 300/400ms (OFF 1,4 -> ON 0). (2) NO collisions anywhere through 400ms at
40 km/h: the physics cliff is beyond 400ms here, so 40 km/h is logic-limited not
physics-limited. The 50 km/h Oracle speed-sweep point is what should bring the
physics cliff into the 0-400ms window.

**SBA AoI blind spot (real finding + bug, needs handling before figures):**
at lat 100ms, ON and OFF are IDENTICAL ([7,8] both) -- SBA does nothing at that
one AoI while working at every other. Root cause from logs: the ghost (track 72,
cid=-1) is a stale STATIONARY ego-duplicate ~0.9-2.4m behind the moving ego.
SBA's beacon-ID suppression never fires because the 100ms-aged beacon fails to
associate the ego's identity onto the stale RSU detection, so it stays
anonymous. The two spatial-gate fallbacks then both miss it: footprint box is
too tight (>~1m off-center), and the speed-gate requires the track speed to
match ego speed but a stale duplicate looks stationary (obs_spd=0 vs ego~10).
So beacon-to-detection association degrades with AoI, leaving a ~100ms window
where the ego track is neither ID-matched nor spatially gated. At lat 0 beacon
and detection coincide (footprint catches it); at 200ms+ the stale detection
ages out / predictor drops it.

**OFF arm is non-monotonic** (11->7->0->1->4): ghosting is not a smooth latency
trend, it is sensitive to AoI-vs-geometry alignment. 2 reps is too few; needs
more reps to separate deterministic structure from seed noise.

**Action items:** (a) decide whether to fix the spatial gate (suppress near-ego
stationary anonymous tracks regardless of speed-match) or report the AoI blind
spot as an SBA limitation; (b) more reps at lat 100 to confirm determinism;
(c) the speed sweep (Oracle 30/40/50) for the physics cliff.

## Multi-Ego Scope: Source-Count NOT Cascade (2026-05-31)

Multi-ego is the V2X2V analogue of 1-RSU->2-RSU infra: more vehicle sources ->
more cross-source disagreement -> more duplicate/ego-uniqueness pressure on the
FOCAL ego (Figure C, source-count axis). Cascading/string failures (ego-k brakes
because ego-(k-1) did, reaction time coupled across agents) are explicitly OUT
OF SCOPE for this paper (interesting but separate multi-agent envelope).

**Geometry constraint:** added egos must be LATERAL/cross sources around the
conflict, NOT a longitudinal queue behind the focal ego (which would create
cascade contamination). The existing 16ego config VIOLATES this: cav9/5/6/7/13
are queued directly behind the focal ego on the northbound approach (x~-85,
y=49-65, heading N, 5 km/h). So the existing multi-ego configs are NOT clean
source-count fixtures as-is. Need to regenerate without the rear queue, or count
only laterally-placed egos as sources. Also: focal ego speed must be pinned to
40 km/h across all N (currently mixed 50/70).

32-ego config does not exist. Decision: check 16-ego feasibility at 40 km/h
(does the focal LTAP conflict survive the congestion) before generating 32.

## SenSys Eval Scope Locked + Analytical AoI Envelope (2026-05-30)

**VRF: NOT built for this deadline.** Treat as related-work / architecture
contrast only ("early fusion forms identities after sensor fusion, so it avoids
object-level duplicate-track publication; we do not claim a VRF implementation").
Comparative evaluation uses only built+run baselines: Oracle, 1-RSU I2V, 2-RSU
I2V, vehicle-side tracker (object-sharing), VIPS, LF, LF+SBA. Claiming a CIP/VRF
comparison would overclaim (CIP is built; VRF is not).

**Core SenSys claim (architecture-disambiguation, answers reviewer A/B):**
self-ghosting is not an artifact of vehicle uplink or of MEC-side tracker
placement. It appears whenever object-level multi-source / infra-published tracks
reach the ego planner without an ego-uniqueness contract. Evidence: 1-RSU 5,
2-RSU 7-9 (no uplink), vehicle-side-tracker 29 (consumer-side tracker),
LF+SBA 0/S_op=1, Oracle physics-floor-only.

**Framing rule:** never write "CIP/VRF fail." Write that the failure is missing
ego-uniqueness at a multi-source publish boundary; CIP-like MEC planning changes
the consumer boundary, so its envelope is analyzed at the plan/command interface,
not the object-track interface.

**Three planned figures:** (A) architecture discriminator (self-ghost/km by
config), (B) safety envelope S_op vs AoI with analytic braking-margin boundary
overlaid, (C) duplicate pressure / ego-uniqueness violation rate vs sources.

**Analytical envelope module** `ecav/scenario_testing/evaluations/safety_envelope.py`:
- Two-reference-frame margin (avoids double-counting AoI):
  M_gen = d_e(t_g) - [v_e(rho+dUse) + v_e^2/2a_b + d_buf]  (scenario tuning)
  M_use = d_e(t_u) - [v_e*rho + v_e^2/2a_b + d_buf]         (log validation)
  They agree when ego speed is stable across [t_g, t_u]. Validated: both 0.050.
- delta_max_yield, ego_speed_for_target_delta (tuning solver).
- Cross-traffic: enters truth error (eps_c = v_c*dUse raw, or prediction residual)
  and clear/yield decision, NOT the ego stopping distance. T_c_believed =
  T_c_true + dUse (planner over-estimates time-to-conflict under staleness).
- Cooperative-perception worth-it: Delta* = (d_coop-d_los)/v_c (raw) shrinks with
  v_c; predicted-track Delta* is flat in v_c (prediction decouples worth-it from
  cross speed). This is a real finding for the figure.
- classify() emits yield_safe / clear_safe / stale_track_dangerous / coop_beats_los.

**Tuning:** model says ego 10.22 m/s (36.8 km/h) puts delta_max_yield=0.305s at
the measured decision distance d_e=13.8m. Set ego max_speed 43->37 km/h in the
late_fusion smoke config; validation run in progress.

## LTAP Conflict Fixture Validated + AoI-Aware Braking Margin (2026-05-30)

Built per-tick conflict-kinematics instrumentation to pin the LTAP physics
boundary so collisions can be classified as physics-limited vs timing artifacts.

**Fixture is sound (confirmed from data, not inference).** Direct edge-world dump
showed the 7 actors: ego=patrol(914) at (-84.8,80) northbound; cross-traffic
violator=tesla.model3(915) spawns (-35,127.7), drives west at 13.4 m/s through
the conflict point (-84.8,127.7); 5 stationary occluders at x=-81. Actors spawn
at z=-500 and teleport up when their behavior sequence triggers. The conflict IS
synchronized: at the brake decision both ego and cross-traffic are ~13.5m from
the conflict point.

**New instrumentation:**
- `ecav/core/application/edge/conflict_kinematics_logger.py`: per-tick CSV of
  ego/cross-traffic pose+speed, ego arc-length distance to conflict (along
  planned path, not Euclidean), TTC, delta_TTC, and the AoI-aware braking
  margin M(t) = d_e - [v(rho+dUse) + v^2/2a_b + d_buf], plus tau_max and the
  zero-latency floor margin. cfg-gated via edge `conflict_kinematics` block.
- Base `_live_gt_snapshot()`: unfiltered live world snapshot (the edge's
  `_gt_snapshots` is 50m range-limited + source-tick-keyed, so approaching
  cross-traffic is missing exactly when closing matters). Stores full type_id.
- Base `_log_conflict_kinematics()`; wired into late_fusion `_advance_actors`
  (infra_only/CIP inherit) and PerceptionEdge run_step.
- Per-event AoI fix in behavior_agent: `delta_use_ticks` and `ego_speed_mps`
  now computed (`trigger_tick = global tick via vm.agent._current_global_tick`,
  not the agent's private `_step_count` which starts at 0 → negative AoI).

**Validation result (lat 0, late_fusion smoke):** the brake fires exactly at the
zero-margin crossing. tick 93 arc=13.8m v=11.3 margin=+0.99 tau_max=0.09s no
brake; tick 94 arc=13.2m margin=-0.16 tau_max=-0.01s BRAKE. Margin recovers as
the ego sheds speed, cross-traffic passes, no collision. The classifier works.

**Calibration finding:** the physics boundary is currently ~90ms (tau_max≈0.09s
at the decision point), not the 250-300ms target. To move it, slow the ego
approach or trigger the brake decision earlier (tau_max ~ d_e/v - v/2a_b). Now
tunable deterministically because tau_max is logged at the decision tick.

**Debug lesson:** spent several reruns inferring geometry from spawn coords +
waypoint lists instead of dumping live actor positions. The actual bug was
trivial and visible in one raw dump: snapshot stored `type_id.split('.')[-1]`
= 'model3', so picker `'tesla' in 'model3'` = False, cross-traffic never matched.
Read the data directly first.

Margin math validated vs worked example: d_stop(v=8.5,rho+0.30,a=6,buf=1)=10.42m,
tau_max(d_e=10.4)=0.298s, margin@dUse=0=+2.53m, margin@dUse=0.30=-0.02m.

## Self-Ghosting Is Multi-Source, Not V2X2V or Edge-Prediction-Specific (2026-05-30)

SenSys-resubmission evidence that self-ghosting is intrinsic to multi-source object
fusion, independent of (a) vehicle uplink and (b) where tracking/prediction runs.
All runs sequential (`ecav.py -t <name> --apply_ml`, no `-d`), scenario_3 LTAP, 1 CAV.

**Infra-only (edge tracks + predicts), no vehicle uplink.** GT-confirmed self-ghosts
(brake-triggering track's nearest GT actor is the ego, cid=-1):
- 1-RSU: 5 (lat 0). 2-RSU: 7-9 (lat 0), rising with latency (→14 at 200ms).
- Single RSU still ghosts because cross-camera NMS dedups detections against each
  other but does NOT remove a detection close to the ego; that is the separate
  ego-gate / self-suppression job, which is heuristic (speed-gate + footprint) and
  imperfect. Cross-camera NMS being correct does not prevent it.

**Object-sharing I2V (PerceptionEdge ships detections only; vehicle runs its own
AB3DMOT + linear predictor + planner via `VehicleSideTracker`).** Still self-ghosts:
19 GT ego-matched ghosts (2 distinct anonymous ego tracks) at lat 0, 2-RSU. Proves
the failure is NOT edge-side-prediction-specific: moving the whole stack onto the
vehicle does not escape it, because identity loss + multi-source disagreement are
already baked into the shipped object list.

**SBA (anchoring) on current code closes it.** late_fusion smoke, anchoring ON lat0:
self_ghost 0, other_fp 0, TP 9, S_op=1. The stale 2026-03-12 anchoring-ON data
showing ~218 ghosts is OLD code, not a current regression. NOTE: late_fusion at lat0
does not self-ghost even with SBA OFF (the ego uploads a beacon, so it is identified),
so late_fusion SBA on/off is the WRONG comparison to prove the fix. The clean demo is
infra-only / object-sharing (no beacon identity).

**S_op axis** (`evaluate_manager.py:654`): binary AND of s_coll, s_ghost, s_fp, s_prog
(avg speed ≥ 60% target). Only discriminates once a config achieves 0 ghosts; SBA-on
is the only arm so far with S_op=1.

### Bugs fixed this session
- `edge_manager_prediction_late_fusion...py` `run_step`: detection gate keyed on
  `beacons` presence, so infra-only (no beacons) silently dropped all RSU detections
  (recall 0, all timings 0). Fixed to gate on actual payload; guarded the beacon loop
  against managed vehicles with no beacon.
- New shared lib `ecav/core/tracking/ab3dmot_format.py`: ObstacleVehicle→AB3DMOT bundle
  conversion, used by edge sensor branch + `VehicleSideTracker` (was duplicated).
- `PerceptionEdge.evaluate()` was unimplemented (base raised NotImplementedError),
  crashing report write; added minimal hook.
- `test_runner.py` `start_carla()`: 30s startup timeout too short on this box (every
  5-run CARLA restart failed); bumped to 120s + `-RenderOffScreen` + 3s RPC settle.

### Configs/runners added
- `openscenario_3_edge_infra_only_smoke` (2-RSU) + `_1rsu_smoke` (1-RSU) + runners.
- `openscenario_3_edge_perception_2rsu_smoke` (object-sharing I2V) + runner.
- `openscenario_3_edge_late_fusion_smoke.py` runner (config already had rsu2).
- rsu2 at `[-40.0, 140.0, 7.0]` added to all six scenario_3 late_fusion configs.

### Paper framing (settled with Tyler)
- Two I2V claims: cooperative-prediction-at-edge fails (infra-only ghosts); and
  object-sharing-only ALSO ghosts (vehicle-side tracker), so it is multi-source
  disagreement, not tracker placement.
- Drop "single source = 0 ghosts" (false). Drop bandwidth dismissal of VRF (VRF uses
  diff clouds, Kbps not Mbps). VRF is vehicle-side early fusion, NOT RSU-compute;
  fix `system_architecture.tex:8` + the placeholder VRF bib entry.
- Plans: `docs/agent_plans/infra_only_baseline.md`, `docs/agent_plans/vrf_baseline.md`.

## WorldFusion Fixes (2026-04-26) — Committed, Not Pushed

Two bugs fixed in `edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py`, both Tyler-confirmed correct:

**Tyler's fix (commit `c36e6084`, 2026-04-20)** — pairwise transform and coordinate reference:
- `x1_to_x2` destination: `self.world_anchor` → `[0,0,0,0,0,0]` (true world origin)
- `lidar_pose`/`world_anchor` to post-processor: `[self.world_anchor]` → `[[0,0,0,0,0,0]]`
- Final coordinate offset: hardcoded world_anchor → RSU localizer's actual position each tick

**Agent ordering fix (commit `2a9db949`, 2026-04-26)** — RSU must be agent 0:
- WorldFusion's fusion layer warps all agents' BEV features into agent 0's frame; output is in agent 0's coordinate frame. Post-processor treats `lidar_pose=[0,0,0,0,0,0]` (origin) as reference — RSU must be agent 0.
- Was: vehicles collected first (agent 0), RSUs after. Fix: RSUs first (agent 0), vehicles after.
- Also fixed `vehicle_poses = poses[num_rsus:]` in self-beacon filter (was `poses[:num_vehicles]`).
- Tyler's fix was necessary but not sufficient: correct math on wrong-ordered agents still produces wrong output.

**Camera branch guard** (same commit) — `hasattr(sensor, 'camenc')` instead of `sensor.use_camera`: prevents crash on LiDAR-only model variants.

**Detection confirmed** (`openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion --apply_ml`, sequential, clean CARLA session): ticks 99-100, score=0.871/0.907, ~2m position error. ~7m effective range expected — V2XSim training data is intersection-centric. Ego does not collide with Lincoln; full pipeline confirmed end-to-end.

Commits: `2a9db949` (fix), `647733e4` (logging + KB). Not pushed.

## Distributed Integration — Committed (2026-05-04), Verified

All work from the two implementation sessions (edge fusion + instrumentation/evaluation) committed in `787f4dac`. Pipeline verified end-to-end on `openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion --apply_ml -d`.

**What was fixed and implemented:** see commit `787f4dac` message for full list. High-level:
- `edge_process.py` NOP relay fixed — edge now instantiates and runs the real edge manager
- `CavWorld(apply_ml=False, config={'distributed': True})` in edge container — no YOLOv5 load, correct `run_distributed` flag
- RSU `actor_id < 0` guard — RSUs have no base CARLA actor; skip `world.get_actor()` for static infrastructure
- `_init_task` always-await fix — exceptions from phase A (edge manager init) now surface correctly
- Instrumentation, metrics chain, `is_proxy` on edge managers, edge eval forwarding, verbose flag
- `ecav.py`: missing `scenario_name` after OmegaConf merge
- `openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion.yaml`: reverted ego speed 70 → 43 km/h (Tyler's workaround masked fusion failure)

**Verified behavior (test 3: `--apply_ml -d`):**
- `[DATA_FLOW] tick=N features=2/2 objects=2/2` — both RSU and vehicle send features every tick ✓
- WorldFusion runs each tick and produces detection scores ✓
- Lincoln z≈−502 at spawn (below map) → `in_range=False` → correctly no detections until Lincoln arrives ✓
- SMART builds a 9-tick track on the Lincoln near the intersection; rejects it (need 22 ticks) ✓
- No predictions reach vehicle → no brake signal → collision at tick ~226 ✓

**Key finding: collision is expected and correct.** Tyler's 70 km/h workaround had the ego clear the intersection before the Lincoln arrived, making "no predictions" survivable. At 43 km/h (correct), no predictions = collision. The predictor is the research problem — SMART requires 22 ticks of track history but the Lincoln only provides ~9 before the intersection. This is Tyler's problem to fix, not distributed architecture.

**Test 4 verified (`--apply_ml -d -l`)**: `features=2/2 objects=2/2` every tick via gRPC litserve endpoint (confirmed by `DEBUG:grpc._cython.cygrpc` in edge container per tick). Same SMART maturity failure, same collision. Cleanup crash `edge.profiler.save_report()` on NoneType fixed with guard in `openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion.py:261`.

**Next: tests 5–8** — late fusion variants.

## Next: Full Regression Matrix

All 8 permutations must pass. Flags: `--apply_ml` enables ML; `-l` routes inference to external gRPC server; `-d` distributed actors.

| # | Fusion | `-l` | `-d` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | WorldFusion | no | no | ✓ 2026-04-26 |
| 2 | WorldFusion | yes | no | ✓ 2026-04-29 |
| 3 | WorldFusion | no | yes | ✓ 2026-05-03 — pipeline verified, collision expected (SMART maturity) |
| 4 | WorldFusion | yes | yes | ✓ 2026-05-03 — identical to test 3; gRPC feature extraction confirmed via litserve |
| 5 | Late fusion | no | no | ✓ 2026-05-03 — no collision; SMART loaded; YOLO detections flowing; V2X beacon caught Lincoln |
| 6 | Late fusion | yes | no | — |
| 7 | Late fusion | no | yes | — |
| 8 | Late fusion | yes | yes | — |

Run in order 1→8: sequential before distributed, WorldFusion before late fusion.

## Multi-Ego Scenarios: Distributed Readiness (2026-04-27)

**All multi-ego scenarios (`_4ego`, `_2ego`, `_8ego`, `_16ego`) are distributed-only** — they `assert opt.distributed` at startup and will refuse to run without `-d`.

**Teardown**: Applied `num_completed_vehicles` fix to all 5 multi-ego files plus both single-ego files. Encapsulated as `ScenarioManager.all_vehicles_done` property in `sim_api.py`. All 7 scenario files now call `scenario_manager.all_vehicles_done` instead of the inline check.

---

## Distributed Teardown Bug — Fixed and Verified (2026-04-29)

**Symptom**: `openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion -d` never exits — ego keeps getting ticks after reaching destination, edge eventually times out, start_actors gives up after 5 min.

**Root cause (two-layer)**:

1. **Edge barrier**: `edge_process.py::process_tick` waits for `len(self.actors)` updates via `Edge_ActorSendUpdate` every tick. Once ego sends `TICK_DONE` it stops calling `send_vehicle_update`. Edge hangs on every subsequent tick (30 s timeout). Partial fix already applied: `is_done` flag on `EdgeActorInfo`, barrier now uses `expected = sum(1 for a if not a.is_done)`.

2. **Orchestrator visibility**: `Edge_TickComplete` in the C++ server does nothing but count edges. `pendingReplies_` is never populated in edge mode — vehicles talk to the edge, not the C++ server, so `Client_SendUpdate` is never called. Python's `server_unpack_vehicle_updates` finds nothing, `num_completed_vehicles` stays zero, `all_vehicles_done` never fires. This is the deeper problem.

**Why "edge done" is the wrong framing**: Edges manage geographic locales — vehicles enter and exit. Only vehicles are permanently done. The C++ orchestrator must remain the single source of truth for per-vehicle doneness.

**Architecture**: Edge forwards individual vehicle state-change events (TICK_DONE) to C++ via a new `repeated VehicleUpdate vehicle_updates` field in `EdgeTickComplete`. C++ processes them identically to a direct `Client_SendUpdate(TICK_DONE)` — pushes to `pendingReplies_`, increments `numCompletedVehicles_`, behind an idempotency set. Python's existing path works unchanged.

**C++ global state model** (target):
- `numEdgesRepliedTick_` (rename from `numCompletedEdges_`) — per-tick edge reply counter, reset each tick
- `completedVehicleIndices_` (new) — permanent set; `.size()` replaces `numCompletedVehicles_` as done-vehicle count (O(1), no redundant counter)

**Plan**: `docs/agent_plans/edge_tick_complete_summary.md`

**Status**: Implemented and verified (2026-04-29). Clean exit confirmed on `openscenario_3_edge_worldfusion --apply_ml -d`. Not yet committed.

**Changes made**:
- `ecav/protos/ecloud.proto`: added `repeated VehicleUpdate vehicle_updates = 4` to `EdgeTickComplete`
- Python stubs regenerated (root `ecloud_pb2.py` + `ecav/protos/`)
- `ecav/ecloud_server/ecloud_server.cc`: renamed `numCompletedEdges_` → `numEdgesRepliedTick_`; added `std::set<int32_t> completedVehicleIndices_`; `Edge_TickComplete` now processes `vehicle_updates` (check set, insert, push to `pendingReplies_` under `mu_`); `Edge_Register` now populates `edgeInfo.vehicle_indices` before pushing to `edgeInfos_`
- C++ server rebuilt cleanly
- `ecav/ecav2/edge_process.py`: `push_tick_to_actors` skips done actors; `process_tick` snapshots `prior_done` before tick, computes `newly_done` after wait loop; `report_tick_complete` populates `vehicle_updates` for newly-done VEHICLE actors

**Next**: commit, then continue regression matrix (tests 3–8)

## WF_GRPC_ENDPOINT Fix for Distributed Containers (2026-04-29) — Committed

**Problem**: `-l -d` (WorldFusion + distributed actors) tried `localhost:18000` (HTTP LitServe) instead of `localhost:18002` (gRPC). Root cause: `CavWorld` is initialized `config=None` in the distributed actor container, so `ml_manager` gets an empty config dict and `worldfusion_grpc_endpoint` defaults to `None`. gRPC path skipped; HTTP fallback fires.

**Fix**: `start_actors.sh` — set `wf_grpc_env="-e WF_GRPC_ENDPOINT=localhost:18002"` when `-l` active; pass to ego and RSU `docker run` commands. This is the first-checked path in `worldfusion_perception_manager.py`.

**Late fusion unaffected**: `ml_manager._init_distributed()` creates YOLO gRPC channel directly to `yolo_endpoint` (default `localhost:18001`); `perception_manager.py` calls `ml_manager.detect()` which uses the pre-initialized stub. No env var needed.

All 4 WorldFusion tests now passing (2026-04-29).

---

## Late Fusion Self-Detection Regression — RESOLVED (Not a Real Regression)

**Was**: `openscenario_3_edge_late_fusion --apply_ml` — ego detected itself as an obstacle, 86 brakes, collision.

**Actual cause**: Two bugs silenced the pipeline entirely — (1) wrong SMART checkpoint path (`ecav/core/prediction/...` instead of `models/smart/...`) fell back to linear predictor, which never loaded CUDA, causing `EdgeProfiler._start_frame` to crash every tick with `Invalid device argument` from `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats(0)` before any tracking ran. (2) Profiler crash propagated out of `run_step`, so zero predictions reached the vehicle.

**Fixes**: `openscenario_3_edge_late_fusion.yaml` checkpoint path corrected; `edge_profiler.py` probes device once at init and gates `sample_gpu_utilization` — no crash if no CUDA context.

**Test 5 result (2026-05-03)**: No collision, SMART loaded, YOLO detections flowing from RSU, no self-detection, no ghost brakes. Ego avoided collision via V2X beacon (Lincoln broadcasts position; SMART never fired because Lincoln track window is ~9 ticks, same as WorldFusion).

---


## Code Quality Changes (2026-04-27)

- `ecav/utils.py` (new): `find_unpicklable(obj, path="")` — pure recursive helper, no side effects
- `ecav/ecav2/ecloud_actor_client.py`: removed inline `find_unpicklable` definition, converted serialization error prints to `logger.error`
- `ecav/distributed_client/distributed_actor_client.py`: removed `_debug_unpicklable_objects` method, same cleanup, removed stray `print("Edge Predictions:")`
- `ecav/.claude/CLAUDE.md`: added "Code Quality: Progressive Cleanup Policy" section (print→logger driveby on any file touched) and "Plans" section overriding plan directory to `docs/agent_plans/`

## WIP / Exploratory

### Edge-Only Distributed Mode (2026-05-09)

Architecture plan: [edge_only_distributed_mode.md](../../agent_plans/edge_only_distributed_mode.md).

**Motivation:** Research focus is the edge node itself (fusion pipeline, latency, handoff). Edge-only mode runs edges in Docker (isolated, profilable) while vehicle + RSU stay in the base process (sequential-style, zero gRPC overhead).

**Architecture decision:** Direct fusion interface. Edge exposes `Edge_PerformFusion(IntermediateFeaturesBatch) → FusionResult` as a per-tick RPC. Base process calls it directly after local perception. No C++ orchestrator, no actor registration.

**Phase 0 complete.** Key findings:

- `Edge_PerformFusion` is defined in proto (line 476) but has no handler in `EdgeServer`
- `run_edge_step()` from commit `787f4dac` is the direct implementation reference — it does feature unpack + `edge_manager.run_step()` + per-vehicle prediction serialization. The standalone handler wraps this same logic
- `FusionResult` proto needs `bytes pickled_predictions = 5` added — the existing `detections` field carries `EdgeObstacleObject` proto structs, not the pickled `ObstaclePrediction` objects the planning pipeline expects
- RSU features flow through the same path as vehicle features (`update_information()` iterates all members)

**`start_actors.sh` verified clean** after merge with 787f4dac remote — YAML parsing, verbose flag, and fusion prompts all intact.

**Phase 1 pending:**

- Add `bytes pickled_predictions = 5` to `FusionResult` in `ecloud.proto`, recompile
- Add `--standalone` / `--config` args to `edge_process.py`
- Implement `Edge_PerformFusion` handler in `EdgeServer`
- Add standalone `run()` path that skips orchestrator registration

**Implementation scope (Phases 2–3 still pending):**

- New `ecav/scenario_testing/utils/edge_fusion_client.py`: gRPC client with retry-connect
- `ecav.py`: `-eo` flag, skip C++ server in this mode
- `EdgeManager.run_step()` split: `collect_features()` + `apply_predictions()`
- `start_actors.sh`: skip vehicle containers in edge-only mode

### Multi-Edge Locale & Handoff Architecture (2026-04-18)

Architecture plan written. See [multi_edge_locale_handoff.md](../../agent_plans/multi_edge_locale_handoff.md).

**Scope:** Two interrelated problems — locale ownership (how an edge claims geographic CARLA space) and vehicle handoff (how vehicles transfer between edges when crossing locale boundaries).

**Locale v1:** Rectangular bounding box (min/max XYZ in YAML `locale_bounds` field). Spawn-time geometric assignment replaces explicit vehicle lists. Transition zone width is a research variable.

**Handoff models (all three to implement and compare):**
- **Model C (first):** Orchestrator-driven via CARLA direct position query. Lowest cost; cleanest experimental baseline.
- **Model A (second):** Vehicle-driven; most V2X deployment-realistic.
- **Model B (third):** Edge-driven with peer-to-peer channels; warmest handoff; most complex.

**State transfer:** Cold start in v1 (handoff gap is the research signal). Warm handoff (state serialization) is Phase 2 and a core Paper 2 research variable.

**Paper mapping:**
- Paper 2: Multi-edge handoff characterization (handoff gap, cold vs. warm, Model A/B/C comparison, latency stacking)
- Paper 3: Scaling (N-edge tick throughput, simultaneous crossings, city-block grid)

**Status:** Plan written; implementation not yet started. Next step: Phase 0 (locale YAML schema + `compute_edge_mappings()` geometric rewrite).

### Azure Distributed Deployment (2026-04-06)

Planning phase. See [azure_deploy.md](../../agent_plans/azure_deploy.md).

**Topology**: 5-node split — node-0 (CARLA + ecav.py), node-1 (ecloud_server), node-2 (inference), node-3 (GPU actors), node-4 (CPU actors).

**Key finding**: codebase is already ~90% wired for multi-node. `sim_api.py:580` already skips spawning `ecloud_server` when `ECLOUD_IP != 'localhost'`. Only code change needed: `ecav.py:43` hardcodes `ECLOUD_SERVER_ADDRESS = "localhost:50051"` — must read from `cloud_config.yaml` for actor containers on remote nodes.

**Approach**: Ansible for cluster orchestration; per-node startup scripts extracted from `start_actors.sh`; `cloud_config.yaml` rendered per-node from Jinja2 template.

**Status**: Plan written, not yet implemented.

## Backlog

### multiv2x_mtr placeholder feature cache in git (follow up with Tyler)

`ecav/ml_manager/models/multiv2x_mtr/multiv2x_fused_features_placeholder/` — 11,136 sparse `.npy` files. Apparent size ~84GB, actual disk ~218MB. Were committed to git and included in Docker build context, inflating the Docker image from ~17GB to ~130GB.

Fixed (2026-04-27): removed from git tracking (`git rm --cached -r`), added to `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`.

**Follow up with Tyler**: confirm whether these files should be regenerated at container startup, pulled from a separate store, or excluded entirely. The directory name ("placeholder") suggests they're pre-allocated slots for a feature cache, not actual trained data — but Tyler should confirm the intended workflow.

### `vehicle_count` / `num_completed_vehicles` are class variables, not instance variables (`sim_api.py`)

Declared at class scope (lines 276-278) but mutated on the instance. Python's attribute lookup finds the instance copy on write, so it works correctly — but the intent is clearer and safer if they're initialized in `__init__`. Low-priority cleanup; don't fix in isolation, fix when `ScenarioManager.__init__` is already being touched for another reason.

---

### Remove `isEdge_` and associated `is_edge` logic (`ecloud_server.cc`)

`isEdge_` (set in `Server_StartScenario`, L638) gates the `pendingReplies_` path in `Client_SendUpdate` — a path irrelevant in edge mode since vehicles never call it directly. Appears to be legacy from the original edge-as-graph-algorithm implementation (edge overrode waypoints; no perception). Dead code in the current architecture. Remove in a separate cleanup PR; don't conflate with the `edge_tick_complete` fix.

---

### Replace `print` calls with leveled `logger` calls across the codebase

The repo has accumulated a large number of bare `print(...)` calls that should be `logger.debug/info/warning/error` calls. Policy going forward: **any file we touch gets a sweep** — convert prints to properly leveled logger calls and remove any inline debug scaffolding (ad-hoc debug prints, commented-out debug blocks, dead `if verbose:` branches, etc.).

This is a progressive cleanup, not a single-pass effort. Prioritize files touched for other reasons; don't make it a standalone driveby.

---

### Invalid metrics in PlanningMetrics summary dict (`ecav/core/plan/planning_metrics.py`)

- **`distance_traveled_m`**: `update()` skips first 100 ticks (`count > 100` warmup filter) — understates total trip distance by ~5 sim seconds of travel.
- **`edge_ticks_total` + 5 sibling fields**: defined with comment "Confound A diagnostic" but never incremented anywhere. Always zero. Real edge data is in the edge profiler JSON and timing CSVs.

TODO: fix or delete both.

## 2026-05-31 (update 2) — LF-guarded guardrail APPLIED

edge_manager_prediction_late_fusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py: added stale-track
collision suppression (config `stale_track_suppression` default false, `stale_track_n`
default 2). At the publish boundary, tracks whose AB3DMOT `time_since_update >= N`
(coasting, no fresh detection) are withheld from every ego's published prediction set
via `stale_pred_idx`, unioned into the existing per-ego `suppress_set`. Anchoring-
independent, so LF-guarded works without SBA. A detected obstacle has
time_since_update==0 so is never withheld (prof safety check #4). py_compile clean.
Default off => LF-basic unchanged. Tracker object is `self.tracker` (AB3DMOT_libs
model, `.trackers[i].time_since_update/.id`, published tid=id+1).

NOTE on tooling: the read/display layer intermittently fabricated file content this
session (echoed spec text back as source, wrong line numbers). All applied facts were
cross-checked with `substring in open(file).read()` byte tests; Edit matches on real
bytes so the 3 edits are safe. Design doc: docs/agent_plans/lf_guarded_and_taxonomy.md
(VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION section is authoritative; earlier sections have fabricated
anchors and are marked superseded).

Next: smoke (lat0 + lat450, flag on vs off) -> does ego stop crawling at lat0, does a
collision appear at lat450. Then four curves (Oracle / LF-basic / LF-guarded /
LF-guarded+SBA) + 1-RSU/2-RSU I2V. Then SSM/Mamba3DMOT: does the coasting echo appear
there too (user request).

## 2026-06-01 — P2 matrix, taxonomy fix, scenario diagnosis, paper framing

CONTEXT WARNING: the tool DISPLAY layer fabricated success messages repeatedly this
session (fake COMPILE_OK, fake edit-applied, wrong line numbers). All facts below were
verified by base64-encoding python output (display cannot fabricate base64 round-trips)
and by `substring in open(file).read()` byte checks. Trust only base64-verified claims.

### Taxonomy fix (P0) — DONE
Root cause of empty/mislabeled taxonomy: `_track_provenance` deque was pruned the
instant a track died, but brakes fire on stale predictions from already-dead tracks,
so `prov_hist` was empty at label time -> classifier fell to nearest-now ->
track-merge mislabeled as self_ghost. Two fixes (both compile, base64-verified):
1. LF manager (edge_manager_prediction_late_fusion_ab3dmot_linear_predictor.py):
   retain dead-track provenance, size-capped at 256, instead of del-on-death.
2. base.py classifier: promote prov to first-class brake labels
   track_merge -> 'track_merge_identity_switch', external_stale -> 'external_stale_fp'
   (was hardcoded 'other_fp'). self_ghost handled above via continue.
3. base.py: reconcile gt_provenance_class from final gt_brake_class at loop end so the
   two fields cannot disagree (gt_provenance_class was None everywhere, but it is
   READ NOWHERE; gt_brake_class is the authoritative consumer field and was correct).

### LF-guarded (stale-track suppression) — DONE
Env-gated STALE_TRACK_SUPPRESSION=1/0, STALE_TRACK_N (default 2). Withholds AB3DMOT
tracks with time_since_update>=N from the per-ego published set, unioned into the SBA
suppress set (composes with anchoring, order-independent). self.tracker.trackers
carries time_since_update/id; published tid=id+1.

### P2 matrix results (3 reps; experiment dirs)
- SBA-on guard-on  (20260531_225138): lat0/300/450 -> 0 coll, conflictFP 0/0/2,
  classes all true_positive except 2 track_merge at 450. avg 8.29/7.74/7.28.
- SBA-off guard-on (20260531_230213): lat0/100/200 -> 0 coll, conflictFP 38/24/10,
  dominated by track_merge_identity_switch (37/21/10), a few external_stale. ZERO self_ghost.
- Oracle           (20260531_231256): lat300/450 -> 0 coll, conflictFP 4/0.

### KEY DIAGNOSIS: scenario does NOT expose the collision/physics boundary
From /tmp/conflict_kin_99.csv (215 ticks): ego emergency-brakes at tick 52 when it is
38.5 m from the conflict and the Tesla is still 42.6 m away (closing ~10 m/s). It
stops with huge separation; 450 ms AoI (~6 m Tesla position error) is irrelevant at
that range. The earlier "+8.7 m margin" was a post-stop residual, not the decision
margin. The RSS-latched emergency stop fires on the REAL Tesla TP at a large
look-ahead, so AoI never bites. Oracle confirms (0 collisions). Ego CAN reach conflict
at speed (re-accelerates to 6.55 m/s post-clear, tick 158, brake_margin -5.59), it just
always yields early when the Tesla is present.

### DECISION (Tyler + prof): split the paper logic
A. FREEZE current P2 as the IDENTITY-AMBIGUITY result, not a collision-boundary result.
   Story: SBA prevents mixed-provenance publish-boundary identity failures
   (track_merge) from reaching the planner (SBA-off 38/24/10 -> SBA-on 0/0/2); guard
   handles orthogonal temporal-validity (stale/coasting) leakage. Main claim is
   planner-facing obstacle correctness, NOT collision avoidance.
B. Build a SEPARATE P2-Boundary scenario variant (raise ego/cross speed or retime
   conflict; do NOT weaken controller) so Oracle collides past a latency threshold.
   Then overlay analytic/RSS boundary (safety_envelope.py) as support, not replacement.
C. Architecture paragraphs ADDED to notes/paper_extract/contents/system_architecture.tex:
   "Object sharing and planner interface" + "Placement of the tracker". 7 new bib keys
   in references.bib (etsi_cpm, sae_j3224, yurtsever2020survey, ghorai2022state,
   karle2022scenario, autoware_prediction, autoware_planning), all USED+INBIB verified.
   Framing only (CPM/J3224 object sharing standard; detection->track->predict->plan is
   standard AV interface; failure is placement-independent edge-or-vehicle tracker).
D. Taxonomy consistency fix done (see above). No 10-rep sweep until P2-Boundary exists
   and labels verified on a fresh run.

### NEXT
- Build P2-Boundary scenario variant (timing/speed tuning to expose collisions).
- One fresh run to confirm gt_provenance_class now consistent with gt_brake_class.
- Then final sweeps. P1 (ambiguous-track brake-admission gate) still optional/deferred.

The paper's main claim is now CLEANER and matches the MobiCom critique: SBA is not just
suppressing ego ghosts; it prevents mixed-provenance publish-boundary identity failures
from entering the planner. The stale-track guard handles the orthogonal temporal failure.

# Preserved from develop (edge-only distributed mode line)

The 2026-06-17 merge of develop into this branch resolved the
current_state.md conflict by keeping this branch's version, which dropped
the sections below. Restored verbatim from origin/develop on 2026-07-08.

## Active Work: Edge-Only Distributed Mode
---

# Follow Up (Tyler Sync)

Items to raise at next Tyler sync:

- **Phase 2 `-eo` distribution plan (Step 8)** — separate plan needed before building. Discuss scope and what Tyler has already scaffolded (registration server, edge-fusion client) vs. what needs wiring.
- **Curved-road suppression bug `behavior_agent.py:1573` — CONFIRMED and FIXED (`b954dbc9`).** Previously flagged from a code read only; now empirically confirmed as the proximate cause of a real collision. Re-running Scenario B sequential after the RSU-refresh fix (`fef25d41`) produced a sustained (13s, hundreds of `Collision` warnings) ego/stationary-ambulance creep-collision. `curved=True` latched continuously from tick 440 through the collision window in that run, vs flickering ~15-20% of samples with no sustained run in the two immediately-preceding non-colliding runs. Once latched, the step-8 guard's `potential_curved_road` term forced `car_following_flag=True` regardless of `overtake_allowed`/`overtake_counter`, permanently blocking the step-9 overtake path. Fixed by removing that term from the guard — the other two conditions (`not overtake_allowed`, `overtake_counter>0`) are sufficient on their own. This is shared planning logic, not Phase-2-scoped; flag for Tyler sync as a heads-up (already applied) and re-run the regression matrix against it.
- **Track-birth timing findings** — Scenario B debugging established that AB3DMOT needs `min_hits=3` confirmed detections before a track is published. At 50ms world_dt that's 3 ticks. Relevant for Phase 2 advance-warning window claims.
- **Warm import gate (Phase 1.5) — RAISE THIS FIRST.** `handoff_warm_import` defaults False and is settable from nowhere (not YAML, not any `__init__`). It gates both vehicle and obstacle import. So run 12 injected nothing at edge 1 and the 82-tick window is a geometric proxy, not a realized benefit. Needs import-side reconciliation to avoid stale-duplicate ghosts. This is now Step 1 of Phase 2 and gates all distribution work — if the warm-vs-cold delta measures ~0, the framing needs rework.
- **`_PluggableEdgeBase` MRO change** — the 2026-07-27 develop merge removed `AB3DMOTStateTransferMixin` from `_PluggableEdgeBase`'s MRO and replaced it with inline dual-backend dispatch. Check whether any of Tyler's test fixtures do `isinstance(edge, AB3DMOTStateTransferMixin)` — those would now fail.
- **Shared TTC threshold conflict, fixed `653082ed`, confirmed + cleaned up `2635fa03`: `collision_time_ahead` was reused for two physically different checks.** After the two fixes above, Scenario B sequential still produced a single clip against the ambulance. Root cause (confirmed via temporary instrumentation, `ebd5e18d`/`325e9b31`): `collision_manager()`'s `self._collision_check.time_ahead` was shared between (1) the ambulance-braking trigger on ego's own path (correctly tuned for a stationary hazard, fires ~44m out) and (2) the candidate lane-change path safety check inside `overtake_management` (checked against the scenario's fast NPC, 18 m/s constant). The same 4s TTC threshold demands ~72m clearance from an 18 m/s hazard vs. a much shorter braking distance from a stationary one — confirmed exactly: ego committed to the overtake with the NPC 70.7m away, almost precisely 18×4. By then ego had burned nearly all of the ambulance's 44m buffer, leaving ~10m — not enough to complete the lateral shift. Fixed by giving the adjacent-lane candidate-path check ([behavior_agent.py](../../ecav/core/plan/behavior_agent.py), `collision_manager`) its own threshold, `overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead` (default 2.0s — `collision_time_ahead`'s own value before the run-10/11 stationary-obstacle-specific bump to 4), selected via the existing `adjacent_check` flag with no call-site changes needed. **Confirmed across 3 consecutive sequential runs**: 0 collisions, `ghost_brake_events=0`, `MEASURED=29 ticks` identical each time; position-logged dry-run rejections showed the trigger was always the NPC (occasionally logged `carla_id=-1` on an unresolved-identity tick, same track by position) — the ambulance never moved and was never the trigger. Temporary diagnostic logging removed once confirmed.
- **`46216a12` merge regression, fixed `fef25d41`: RSU perception never refreshed in sequential mode (`PredictionLateFusionEdge` only).** The same merge that removed the mixin from `_PluggableEdgeBase`'s MRO also extracted `PredictionLateFusionEdge.run_step()`'s per-tick advance block into `_advance_actors()` and dropped the RSU loop (`rsu.update_info(); rsu.run_step()`) that existed inline at run-12 (`6cefda1a`) — the new method's own docstring still promised it. Any RSU-only edge (edge 0 once its managed vehicle hands off) got zero live tracker output for the rest of any sequential run. Surfaced when re-running Scenario B for Phase 2 Step 1: obstacle handoff never fired in three consecutive runs, and one run ended in an ego/ambulance collision. Fixed by restoring the loop. **Checked `WorldFusionEdge` and `_PluggableEdgeBase` — both correctly gate an RSU refresh under `if not self.run_distributed:` in their sequential paths (`_run_fusion` and `_advance_vehicles` respectively). Confirmed isolated to the late-fusion class.**
- **Open diagnostics in scenario file** — `[EGO-DBG]` and `[SCENB-DBG]` still at WARNING level in `openscenario_multi_edge_right_merge.py`. `[TRACK-DBG]` was resolved in the merge. Remove before Phase 2.
- **PACE MTR training status** — job 10846208 (8x H200, two-stage clean data) submitted 2026-07-07. Check if it completed and what minADE landed.
- **Docker cleanup** — `docker system df` showed build cache ~80GB with ~41GB reclaimable. Run `docker system prune` when convenient.
- **Scenario B MAX_STEP** — ego reaches x=384 at tick=695 but destination is x=600; scenario terminates before full route completion. Not a research blocker (merge sequence is the contribution) but worth noting.
- **LOW PRIORITY — after his defense, not before:** `1f970053` (Tyler's own July 8 commit) introduced a third bug in the same file as the RSU regression: `_ab3d_history_to_trajs`'s zombie filter (`live_tids = {trk.id + 1 ...}`) never matched `output()`'s actual row format (`[trk.id]`, no offset) — every genuinely-alive track was treated as a zombie unless some other track's `id - 1` happened to also be alive. Fixed in `22f455a0`, same commit as a `max_age` grace-period fix for warm-imported tracks. **Bounded check (not a full audit) found no evidence this affects any of his reported dissertation numbers** — Table 6.1 comes from `migration/harness.py`, a fully synthetic microbenchmark that never touches `_ab3d_history_to_trajs`; the two-locale MTR/SSM live-handoff result uses the Mamba/`_PluggableEdgeBase` path, confirmed bug-free; B0.1's vehicle-handoff validation is dated 2026-07-05, three days before the bug was introduced. Only caveat: can't rule out a *later* re-run against buggy `develop` between July 8 and today. Worth a two-minute confirmation with Tyler sometime, not urgent.
- **Reconciliation limitation, left unfixed by design (see Phase 2 plan, "Step 1 conclusion"):** even with the above bugs fixed, a warm-imported KF's constant-velocity-coasted position carries a persistent ~6-15m bias from ground truth that doesn't close over time, well outside AB3DMOT's own ~2m association gate — so the destination's eventual real detection reliably fails to reconcile with the injected track and spawns a new one instead. Tyler's Khonsu design (dissertation Section 6.3.3) already has the right answer — an explicit prepare-commit ownership/epoch protocol that doesn't depend on organic re-association — so this wasn't chased further; the primitive KF-injection mechanism in the current eCAV codebase just doesn't have that layer yet.

## DONE: Phase 1 Scenario B — Right-Merge Obstacle Handoff (2026-07-27)

**Result:** All Phase 1 Scenario B requirements met. Run 12 (commit `6cefda1a`).

> **Scope caveat (established 2026-08-15).** Run 12 validated the *export* half.
> `handoff_warm_import` defaults False and is settable from nowhere — not the
> YAML, not any `__init__` — and the gate covers both `import_vehicle_state`
> (`ab3dmot_state_transfer.py:162`) and `import_tracked_obstacle_state`
> (line 204). Scenario B's edges are `manager_type: late_fusion` →
> `PredictionLateFusionEdge(AB3DMOTStateTransferMixin, …)`, so **no KF was
> injected at edge 1 in run 12**. The 82-tick advance-warning window is tick
> arithmetic over a 60 m geometric proxy computed in the scenario file; it never
> reads edge 1's tracker and would print 82 with the import call deleted. It
> measures opportunity, not realized benefit. Phase 1.5 (enable warm import +
> import-side reconciliation) is now Step 1 of the Phase 2 plan and gates
> everything downstream.

| Event | Tick | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Vehicle handoff | 63 | vid, 986 bytes, full KF state |
| Ambulance detected by edge predictions | ~305 | dist=42.3m (before local sensor range) |
| **Predictive obstacle handoff** | 161 | NPC at x=98.3, 16.7m before locale boundary |
| RSU1 first detects NPC | 243 | **advance-warning window = 82 ticks (4.1s)** |
| Ego merges right | ~500 | 4.3m lateral clearance, no crash |

**Three bugs fixed to reach this:**
1. `if not beacons:` guard in jitter buffer drain silently dropped all RSU detections after ego handoff (vehicle_manager_list empty → beacons dict empty → guard fired). Fixed: `if not beacons and not objects.get('vehicles'):`.
2. `KeyError` in `_collect_ab3d_detections` — VM in list but not in beacons snapshot (timing race at handoff boundary). Fixed: `if vm.vehicle.id not in beacons: continue`.
3. `_find_obstacle_kf` position fallback always returned None — used `kf.x[1]` (CARLA_z height ≈ 0) instead of `kf.x[2]` (CARLA_y lateral ≈ 140). KF state layout: `[x, y, z, theta, l, w, h, dx, dy, dz]` → `x[0]=CARLA_x`, `x[2]=CARLA_y`. Made NPC-to-KF distance ≈ 140m always >> `max_dist_m=15`. Fixed index to `[2]`.

**Key geometry:** Town06 right-merge (CARLA left-handed frame; +y is the vehicle's RIGHT heading east). Ego + ambulance in lane y≈137, NPC in lane y≈140. RSU0 at x=55 (moved from x=75 to clear near-field blind donut). Locale boundary x=115.

**Plan:** `docs/agent_plans/edge_handoff_phase1_state_transfer.md` (Steps 0–7 checked off).

---

## Next: Phase 2 — Distributed Edges + gRPC State Transfer (2026-08-16)

**Plan:** `docs/agent_plans/edge_handoff_phase2_distributed_state_transfer.md`
**Status (2026-08-22):** Sequential baseline (Step 0 two-edge bring-up + Step 1 cold measurement) is solid — 3 consecutive clean runs, 0 collisions, `MEASURED=29 ticks` reproducible. Step 1's warm-vs-cold comparison ran and its "delta = 0" result was traced to the actual mechanism, not just measured — see "Step 1 conclusion" in the plan for the full writeup. Short version: two real bugs fixed (off-by-one zombie filter, `22f455a0`; `max_age` grace period for warm-imported tracks, same commit), one deeper structural limitation identified and left unfixed (constant-velocity coasting doesn't stay within AB3DMOT's tight ~2m association gate over a long unobserved window) because Tyler Landle's dissertation (Khonsu, Chapter 6) already specifies the correct fix — an explicit prepare-commit ownership protocol that doesn't depend on organic re-association at all. A bounded regression-scope check (not a full audit) found no evidence either bug affects Tyler's reported dissertation numbers (Table 6.1's harness bypasses the buggy code path entirely; the two-locale MTR/SSM result uses an unaffected tracker backend; B0.1's vehicle-handoff validation predates the bug by 3 days) — flagged as worth a quick confirmation with Tyler if it comes up, not urgent given his defense is this week.

Scope: Scenario B only. Decisions D-8 … D-15 recorded in the plan.
Hub transport first, then peer; cost gating config-flagged default off.

**Sequencing is Phase-1.5-first, not distribution-first.** Distributing the
edges before warm import works builds a real gRPC hop carrying a real payload
that the destination discards. Step 1 (sequential, in-process, fast iteration)
must show a non-zero warm-vs-cold delta before Steps 2–6 are worth doing.

### What landed in 983644ae

**Step 0 code (no CARLA run yet):**
- `edge_registration_server.py`: D-15 edge binding from `container_name` not arrival order; collision/parse errors now fatal.
- `openscenario_multi_edge_right_merge.py`: `zip(edge_list, fusion_clients)` → explicit `fc_by_edge_idx` map; NPC uniqueness check; `fc_by_edge_idx = {}` guard at top of `run_scenario`.

**Step 1 code (no CARLA run yet):**
- `openscenario_multi_edge_right_merge.yaml`: `handoff_warm_import: false` in `edge_base` (set true to enable warm import).
- `PredictionLateFusionEdge.__init__`: `self.handoff_warm_import = bool(cfg.get(...))` + `self._first_track_publish_tick: Dict[int,int] = {}`.
- `PredictionLateFusionEdge.import_vehicle_state` (class override): added `_warm_import_enabled()` gate (the override was bypassing the mixin's gate).
- `WorldFusionEdge.__init__`, `_PluggableEdgeBase.__init__`: same `handoff_warm_import` read.
- `_PluggableEdgeBase`: added `_warm_import_enabled()` + gated `_import_track_latent` (F8 reconciliation).
- `daemon.py`: `MigrationPayload.deserialize(payload.serialize())` round-trip in both `request_handoff` and `transfer_obstacle_state`. Confirmed: `payload_bytes()=1050` ≠ `len(pickle)=1696` — D-14 parity invariant intact.
- `_ab3d_history_to_trajs`: optional `tick` parameter; `[TRACK_PUBLISH]` log on first per-cid trajectory appearance. Scenario closing log adds `MEASURED` window beside `PROXY` window.

**Import-side reconciliation analysis — superseded, see "Step 1 conclusion" above.** (Original estimate — warm track pruned ~tick 185 via `max_age=6`, safely before RSU1's ~tick 243 detection, so no ghost risk — was based on the 60m geometric proxy, not the actual first-detection tick. The real mechanism is more involved: two real bugs plus one structural limitation, fully written up above.)

### Step 0/1 status — audited 2026-08-22, corrected from earlier overstatement

- [x] Step 0: single-edge `-eo` regression (`openscenario_3_edge_late_fusion`) — clean, no regression.
- [~] Step 0: two-edge `-eo` right-merge bring-up — **infrastructure confirmed working** (`nAHj5t.log`, full 700-tick completion, after the `[EDGE-ONLY]` print fix `0767ed3a`), **but not run with the handoff block disabled as the plan's own item specifies.** Retroactive audit of that log confirmed F2's predicted silent degradation exactly (`no KF for carla_id=122` repeating, `no obstacle handoff fired`).
- [ ] Step 0: **`edge_profiler_<ts>.json` confirmed NOT written** — zero profiler files exist from this session anywhere in the repo; no `end_scenario`/`Edge_EndScenario` log line at all in the successful `-eo` run. Genuinely broken, not investigated further yet.
- [ ] Step 0: F6 checks (does `collect_features` need `update_information()` for late fusion; does `beacon_id_mgr` diverge base vs. container) — never investigated.
- [ ] Step 0: Counter-H2 one-tick lag characterization — never investigated.
- [ ] Step 0: confirm vehicle drives on container-fused predictions vs. silent local fallback — no log evidence either way, unverified.
- [x] Step 1 cold baseline: sequential right-merge, `handoff_warm_import: false` — `MEASURED=29 ticks`, confirmed reproducible across 3 runs (`XuwE8k`, `exyzDi`, `vG76bj`), 0 collisions, `ghost_brake_events=0` each time.
- [x] Step 1 warm run and gate: **resolved with a reframed answer, not a stalled `[ ]`.** See "Step 1 conclusion" above — delta was 0 for a specific, now-understood reason (two fixed bugs, one deep limitation deliberately left to Khonsu's design), not because H1 is false. Full writeup in the Phase 2 plan.

**Honesty note:** the two-edge `-eo` and single-edge `-eo` items were previously marked `[x]` in this file based on "the readiness-gate bug is fixed" rather than "the specific checklist item's criteria are met" — those are different claims, and conflating them overstated progress here. Corrected 2026-08-22 after jrapp asked directly whether the unchecked plan items were actually done.

**Three unrelated regressions found and fixed while chasing a clean sequential baseline** (none were Phase-2/warm-import bugs — all were pre-existing, surfaced by finally re-running Scenario B sequential after a long gap):
1. `fef25d41` — RSU perception never refreshed in sequential mode (`46216a12` merge dropped a loop `_advance_actors()`'s docstring still promised).
2. `b954dbc9` — curved-road suppression bug (previously flagged, Tyler-scope, now confirmed via a real collision and fixed).
3. `653082ed` — `collision_time_ahead` shared between two physically different hazards (stationary ambulance vs. 18 m/s NPC); split into `overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead`.

Architectural findings behind the plan:

- **F1** — under `-eo` the tracker lives in the container (`Edge_PerformFusion` overwrites the VM/RSU lists with `_FeatureStub`s each tick); the base-process edge is a perception+planning shell whose tracker never advances.
- **F2** — consequently Scenario B's per-tick snapshot loop under `-eo` exports `kf_state=None` and the handoff silently degrades to nothing. Nothing raises.
- **F3** — the handoff decomposes into *routing* (`relinquish`/`accept` on base shells — unchanged from Phase 1) and *tracker state* (must cross the wire). Only the second needs RPCs.
- **F4** — the container sees only tracks, so **one** RPC pair keyed on `carla_id` + position hint covers both vehicle and obstacle transfer.
- **F5** — `edge_id` is assigned by registration arrival order; `zip(edge_list, fusion_clients)` holds only because `start_actors.sh` serializes container launch. Wrong-locale binding would present as a geometry bug. Bind from `EdgeRegistrationInfo.container_name` instead.
- **F6** — both `collect_features` impls call `update_information()`, running the comm model (latency, packet loss, beacon temp-ids, jitter push) in the base process where nothing drains it. `BeaconIdManager._random_temp_id()` uses `random.randint`, so base and container temp ids diverge — fine, since the RPC contract is `carla_id`-keyed, but base-side beacon state must never be consulted for identity.
- **F7** — Single-edge `-eo` is validated (Phases 3 and 4 complete in `edge_only_distributed_mode.md` — late fusion confirmed 2026-05-31, WorldFusion confirmed same period). Two-edge `-eo` with ScenarioRunner, handoff block active, and two separate containers is the new, unexercised combination; that is the Step 0 risk.
- **F8** — `AB3DMOTStateTransferMixin._import_track_latent` honors `handoff_warm_import`; `_PluggableEdgeBase._import_track_latent` has no gate and always injects. Mamba and AB3DMOT results are not comparable until this is reconciled.

**Parity invariant:** the cost model must keep using `MigrationPayload.payload_bytes()`, never `len(pickled_payload)` — the pickle wire size is larger and host-dependent, and switching would break the Phase 1 ↔ Phase 2 byte comparison.

## NSDI Paper: scale_out_nsdi (2026-07-07)

Branch `scale_out_nsdi` (commit `33c8a07`). Systems positioning complete: related-work problem-class abstraction, camera-networks subsection, ClairvoyantEdge distinction, system model corrected (locale = CONFLICT ZONE not RSU). Boundary framing: "static canvas, dynamic assignment, ASYMMETRIC elasticity." 74 `\ptag` intent tags, AV-term glosses for systems reviewers. 15pp clean build.

Tyler reading both manuscripts. Professor email drafted.

## Dissertation Proposal (DONE, 2026-07-05)

Five research thrusts, chapter order fixed, P2–P6 complete, 60 pages clean build, 0 warnings. `\ptag` intent tags visible until advisors approve; flip one-line macro in `main.tex` to hide.

## Scale-out B0 (2026-07-05)

**B0.3 DONE — live full-latent migration in CARLA.** `openscenario_3_multi_edge_mamba`. At tick 60: full memo bank (10 frames, 776 B) exported from edge0, injected warm at edge1. Tracklet survived; no post-handoff exceptions. Known gaps: warm-vs-cold DELTA needs B4 metrics; `SOTAEdge.evaluate()` NotImplementedError at cleanup (non-fatal).

**B0.2 DONE — Mamba latent through edge dispatch.** Mamba3DMOT in tracker registry. `_PluggableEdgeBase` dispatches: Mamba → full latent via factories; AB3DMOT → KFState. Both verified under `opencda310` (`test_mamba_edge_migration.py`): banks byte-identical, id preserved, ~1.3 KB.

**B0.1 DONE — live edge migrates KF state.** `PredictionLateFusionEdge` export/import wired with real AB3DMOT KF snapshot (mean, covariance, hits≥min_hits, velocity). Round-trip verified.

## WF→MTR Training (PACE, status as of 2026-07-07)

Goal: train MTR on WorldFusion fused BEV features (CMP-style) for Multi-V2X.

**Current status:** Retrain job 10846208 submitted 2026-07-07 (8x H200, two-stage, ~12h). Used clean re-export (174 GB, 52 zones) after discovering the prior 8-GPU run (10804312) used `train=True` in export → per-frame random augmentation scrambled trajectories → model plateau at ADE ~31m (static baseline). Fixed: `export_wf_for_mtr.py` now uses `train=False`.

**Infrastructure validated** (2x H200 job 10802480): DDP, eval after every epoch, best_model save, clean exit, finite metrics (minADE=nan fix: skip objects with `final_valid_idx<1`).

**Correct model:** `worldfusion_multiv2x_translaug_finetune` (epoch 27/45 local at `ecav/ml_manager/models/`). NOT `caronly_aug` (wrong pick; scene-overfits).

**Key design decision:** everything in RSU-EGO frame. GT boxes + detection positions both in ego frame. No AB3DMOT, no rekey — GT-anchored Hungarian association (gate 2.0m) for building training data. Verified rsu_66: det pos error mean 0.42m, per-frame recall 44%, 1086 trainable samples/zone.

**PACE artifacts:** `$PROJECT/wf_mtr_translaug.tar` (174 GB, READY marker dropped after upload), `$PROJECT/mtr_code.tar`. Sbatches in `ecav/core/prediction/mtr/tools/scripts/`. Lock file pattern: `$PROJECT/mtr_wf_smoke.lock` — always `rm -f` before resubmitting.

**Known issue:** intermittent RSU detections (44% recall) give <2 valid past obs for some records — loader skips those (BatchNorm crash on single-point sequences). CMP-strict would drop these; MTR masks missing past via `obj_trajs_mask`, so lenient selection is correct.

## Phase 1 State Transfer — Steps 0–6 Reference

All committed. See `docs/agent_plans/edge_handoff_phase1_state_transfer.md` for full checklist.

- `migration/payload.py`: `KFState`, `TrackLatent`, `MigrationPayload`.
- `migration/binding.py`: `HandoffManager`, `evaluate()` → `Optional[HandoffEvent]`.
- `edge_manager_base.py`: `export/import_vehicle_state`, `relinquish`, `accept` stubs.
- `ab3dmot_state_transfer.py`: `AB3DMOTStateTransferMixin` — AB3DMOT-aware export/import with position fallback for unmanaged obstacles; mixed into `PredictionLateFusionEdge`.
- `edge_manager_pluggable_base.py`: dual-backend inline dispatch (Mamba + AB3DMOT) — replaces mixin inheritance as of 2026-07-27 merge.
- `sim_api.py`: `_vehicle_state_store`, `store/retrieve_vehicle_state`.
- `migration/link.py`: `TransferCost`, `InterLocaleLink.model_transfer`.
- `migration/daemon.py`: `SequentialMigrationDaemon.request_handoff`, `transfer_obstacle_state`.
- Metrics sink: `record_handoff_cost` on `ScenarioManager`; `handoff_eval` in `EvaluationManager`; `HAND-OFF MIGRATION` block in evaluation report.
- Scenario A validated (2026-06-13): tick=60, 986 bytes, ghost_brake_events=0.

**AB3DMOT warm import is OFF by default** (`handoff_warm_import = False`). Payloads are exported and logged; destination tracker is untouched until Phase 1.5.

## Paper 1 (safety_envelope_sensys) — SUBMITTED

Branch `paper-closed-loop-recreate`. Full analysis in session logs 2026-05-30 through 2026-06-02. Short summary: SBA (anchoring) expands safety envelope from ~100ms logic cliff to ~400ms physics limit. Oracle confirms architecture works when detection is clean. Detailed eval and taxonomy analysis archived in session logs; not recapped here.

---

## Key Invariants

**RSU = agent 0 in WorldFusion.** Fusion layer warps all agents' BEV features into agent 0's frame. RSU must always be first in `rsu_manager_list` and first in `IntermediateFeaturesBatch`. See commit `2a9db949`.

**AB3DMOT detection format = 8 columns.** `_collect_ab3d_detections` produces `[h,w,l,x,y,z,theta,confidence]` — 8 columns. Empty early-exit arrays must be `np.empty((0, 8), np.float32)`. `(0, 7)` is a recurring mistake (2026-05-31 root cause: `Box3D.__init__` defaults `s=0.0`; see session log). `array2bbox_raw` handles 8-column input gracefully (`data[-1]` → `bbox.s`); the `[:7]` strip in `model.py output()` is for the KF-state output path only.

**AB3DMOT KF state vector:** `[x, y, z, theta, l, w, h, dx, dy, dz]` (dim=10). KITTI camera convention: `x[0]=CARLA_x`, `x[1]=CARLA_z (height)`, `x[2]=CARLA_y (lateral)`. Position fallback in `_find_obstacle_kf` must use `x[0]` and `x[2]`, NOT `x[1]`.

**Clean CARLA session required for testing.** `ActorTransformSetter` teleport fails in a dirty session. Always restart CARLA before standalone testing.

**Late fusion vs WorldFusion: different feature field.** Late fusion: `VehicleUpdate.pickled_agent_objects` (YOLO detections). WorldFusion: `IntermediateFeatures.spatial_features` (BEV).

**AB3DMOT Kalman filter uses Joseph form** (commit `902aef96`). Simple `(I-KH)P` causes covariance collapse; Joseph form `(I-KH)P(I-KH)^T + KRK^T` is numerically stable.

**`collision_time_ahead: 4`** in `openscenario_multi_edge_right_merge.yaml`. At 2, hazard fires at ~22m → ego stops 5m from ambulance → collision on creep. At 4, fires at ~44m → ego stops with clearance.

## Backlog (develop line, preserved verbatim)

- **`isEdge_` dead code** (`ecloud_server.cc`) — gates `pendingReplies_` path irrelevant in edge mode. Legacy. Remove in a cleanup PR.
- **`vehicle_count`/`num_completed_vehicles` as class vars** (`sim_api.py:276–278`) — mutated on instance; works but unclear. Fix when `ScenarioManager.__init__` is touched for another reason.
- **`PlanningMetrics` invalid fields** — `distance_traveled_m` skips first 100 ticks; `edge_ticks_total` + 5 siblings never incremented. Fix or delete.
- **`print` → `logger` driveby** — any file touched gets a sweep. Progressive only.
- **multiv2x_mtr placeholder cache** — `ecav/ml_manager/models/multiv2x_mtr/multiv2x_fused_features_placeholder/` removed from git; Tyler to confirm intended workflow.

## Paper 3 (scale_out_nsdi): systems-native reframe (2026-07-12)

Tyler's 21 Overleaf comments on abstract/intro addressed at the root, not surface. The framing is now
mapped onto structures NSDI readers own: the service is a **geo-partitioned stateful service** (locale =
geographic partition, single-writer ownership), per-actor model state is **soft state with asymmetric
cost** (~1 KB to copy, seconds to rebuild via re-observation only), the failure is a **cold cache /
handoff-induced cold start** ("prediction gap" renamed everywhere, incl. motivation subsection, Q1,
conclusion, implementation), and migration is a **prefetch** driven by the workload's own forecasts with
two-phase transfer and explicit **failover**. "map-anchored" removed everywhere. Conductor claims removed
(unpublished, cannot cite). Frame defined ("one snapshot of the scene's sensor data, ten per second")
after Tyler's "Frames of WHAT?". Kalman mean spelled out as mean vector + covariance matrix. All \tl
comments kept in place with `|| FIXED:` annotations. Build clean (0 fatals, 15 pp); the 3 prior fatals
were Tyler's raw `\{...}` comments in the old intro, gone with the rewrite. Pushed as bd36620.

### Register correction (same session, after Tyler feedback)

Second pass pushed as 5fe1646. Corrections from live feedback: cooperative prediction is not
edge-hosted by definition (CMP runs among vehicles); intro now says edge hosting is the studied
deployment. Planner defined as the service's client, its 300 ms reaction budget as the service's
deadline. Explicit analogies removed ("Unlike a database", "timescale of a TCP connection", "cold
cache" figurative use); structural systems terms kept (partition, single-writer ownership, prefetch,
two-phase, failover, cold start). Kalman closed-form comparison kept (Tyler: helpful). "Roughly ten
frames" universal claim dropped. \tl comments now commented out with FIXED notes preserved in source;
\ad and \KR comments (none present yet) still get in-text Fixed annotations when they appear.
New memory: feedback_systems_register_not_analogies.

### Paper 3 restructure + naming (2026-07-13)

The system is named **Foresight** (Tyler's pick from options; rejected Baton/Torch/race metaphors and
"Predictive Latent Migration"). Title: "Foresight: Forecast-Driven Migration of Learned State for
Edge-Hosted Cooperative Prediction". \sys/\Sys macros updated in cmds.tex.

Draft scope narrowed on Tyler's instruction: main.tex now inputs only abstract, introduction, and
Background and Motivation. design/architecture/implementation/evaluation/discussion/conclusion are
commented out (files intact, restore as they mature). Related work moved into motivation as a
subsection (families as \paragraph heads, arch cross-refs rephrased, EdgeWarp duplication trimmed with
commented-out original). New overview figure: contents/fig_overview.tex (TikZ, figure*), same content
as slides/locales_migration.drawio: locales as partitions, single-writer boundary, v crossing with
forecast-as-trigger, actor a, edge track tables, PREPARE/COMMIT, cold-start timeline. Cold-start
subsection walkthrough rewritten around the figure (v/a notation; forecasts only as good as the colder
track). Intro contribution refs to hidden sections commented out except sec:motivation. Also: planner
described by function not "client"; cooperative prediction not defined as edge-hosted (edge-hosted is
the studied deployment). Build clean, 7 pp. Pushed through d80657b.

### Abstract round 2 + locale cardinality (2026-07-13 evening)

Nine new \tl comments on the abstract addressed (pushed 51cf5a2): opens with the unseen-conflict hook
instead of the service; locale defined Tyler's way (region = intersection/merge/stretch, group of
locales covers a metro area); state-size detail removed from abstract; danger made concrete with the
blind-overtake example spanning a locale boundary; "the workload is itself a predictor" replaced with
"the service already computes a trajectory forecast for every vehicle, Foresight uses those forecasts";
protocol presented as design; "planner" removed from abstract; colon chains cut; 3-9x microbenchmark
numbers replaced with a headline-results placeholder. Same fixes propagated to the intro thesis
paragraph.

Cardinality correction from Tyler: a locale is NOT owned by exactly one edge server. The locale-to-
server mapping is a deployment choice (one server can host several locales, one locale can be served by
multiple servers). The fixed invariant is single-writer ownership PER TRACK. Fixed in abstract, intro,
motivation layers paragraph, and figure labels (owned -> served).

### Global writing pass + sizing reframe (2026-07-14)

Pushed 59f77f1 + c634d24. Three global rules applied across ALL content files (visible and hidden):
(1) ptags rewritten as full descriptive sentences, (2) zero semicolons in prose (TikZ code and the
retired related_work.tex excepted), (3) negative-contrast framing removed ("is not X, it is Y" /
"X, not Y") except where it positions against prior work after definitions. Kalman comparison kept
(Tyler: helpful).

MAJOR reframe from Tyler: locale-to-edge mapping is a RESEARCH QUESTION of the paper, not a deployment
footnote. Maximum locale size, locales-per-server, servers-per-metro (how many MECs) are studied
questions. Now framed that way in abstract, intro P2, and motivation layers subsection. New
contribution bullet: locale sizing and allocation. NOTE: the eval currently has no sizing study
(Q1-Q6 don't cover it); the eval plan needs a matching Q/B item before the sections are restored.

Tyler's mid-pass Overleaf edits (kept): "wired backhaul"->"backhaul", conservative-mode sentence
trimmed, success sentence trimmed. His new comment on the last contribution bullet is addressed: new
red \placeholder macro in cmds.tex marks expected-not-measured results; used in the eval contribution
bullet and the abstract headline placeholder. Build clean, 8 pp.

## Dissertation: proposal/dissertation split (2026-07-16)

Per Tyler + advisor 30-page cap, modeled on Anirudh Sarma's accepted proposal (~/Downloads/ANIRUDH_SARMA_PROPOSAL.pdf, body ends p31).

- NEW private repo github.com/tlandle/Dissertation (branch master), seeded with the pre-trim full-depth
  proposal content. This is where dissertation-length text lives.
- Dissertation_proposal repo restructured (b990dd7): related work distributed per chapter (global
  Background+Related chapter reduced to a 2pp Background); shared eval infrastructure folded into the
  eCAV chapter; scale-out chapter rewritten as "Proposed Work" (Motivation / Related Work / Proposed
  System: Foresight / Preliminary Results / Eval Plan Q1-Q7 incl. new Q7 locale sizing); Evaluation
  Plan + Timeline + Broader Impacts chapters merged into one "Dissertation Plan" chapter; intro
  Summary-of-Contributions section deduped away; correctness apparatus and communication design
  compressed (full text preserved in Dissertation repo).
- Terminology synced: Foresight, handoff-induced cold start, locale = geographic partition, sizing as
  research question, no map-anchored/prediction-gap/predictive-latent-migration anywhere active.
- Venue corrections from Tyler: safety envelope = SenSys 2027 (submitted June 2026; bib entry
  landle2026mobicom retargeted, key unchanged); Conductor = SEC 2026, Submitted.
  OPEN: milestones row "Communication Architecture, SenSys 2027, Q1 2027" now collides with the safety
  envelope row (a Q1 2027 deadline would be SenSys 2028); needs Tyler's call.
- Pages: 46 total with visible ptags (body ~34); with ptags off, body ends ~31 + refs to 43. The
  ptag toggle is one line in main.tex.

### Proposal: Overleaf comment round 1 addressed (2026-07-19)

Twelve \tl comments from Tyler addressed across two Overleaf pulls (pushed 74a4eff + 71c1a01):
- Intro rewritten: lead-in from how driving works, "scene understanding" removed (pipeline of
  perception/tracking/prediction defined at the top), LOS defined then abbreviated, V2V/PC5/BSM/
  URLLC/eMBB all defined at first use, SB-SPS corrected (LTE Mode 4 term + NR Mode 2 sensing-based
  successor), per-slot transport-block infeasibility claim replaced with fragmentation + delivery
  probability under load, cloud latency cited, MEC placement no longer "only base stations".
- Thesis statement now claims the paradigm (edge-hosted cooperative prediction is practical and
  superior to vehicle-only sharing and cooperative planning) before the three requirements.
  VRF/CIP/VI-Eye cited (bib entries copied from safety_envelope_sensys).
- Communication direction moved LAST as "Planned Work" (chapter + intro list + abstract list);
  characterization leads, hybrid link design is one candidate outcome. paper3-scaleup opener
  rewritten since it no longer follows the communication chapter.
- "Thrust" removed document-wide (research directions). CWM / Cooperative World Model removed
  (edge-hosted cooperative prediction); WorldFusion kept as the fusion-layer name in ch5.
  Conductor + safety envelope both presented as under submission.
- All ptags rewritten declarative document-wide (his "whole language is imperative" comment).
- Background expanded per his MEC comment: compute placement spectrum (vehicle/RSU/MEC/cloud),
  RTT defined, uplink vs sidelink latency separated, V2V/I2V/V2X2V/V2X + network boundary defined,
  architecture figure (legend/autonomy-pipeline/topologies PNGs) copied from safety_envelope_sensys
  as Fig. bg-arch.
- All his comments kept in source, commented out with || FIXED notes.
Pages: 49 with visible ptags (was 47 before background expansion). Rebase conflict with his second
Overleaf push resolved (background.tex MEC paragraph, his comments + my sweep both kept).

### Proposal: related-work classification (2026-07-19, advisor directive)

Advisor requires explicit comparative vs built-upon vs corollary classification for every cited
system. Done (a6d6b85): each chapter's Related Work restructured into three labeled blocks
(Comparative / Built upon / Related approaches) with per-system relationship stated in prose, plus a
summary table in Background (tab:bg-classification) mapping every system to its relationship and
chapter. Key judgment calls: EdgeWarpified BOTH built-upon (two-phase protocol shape adopted)
and comparative (baseline B2), called out explicitly; VRF/VI-Eye/CIP = comparative architecture
points on the safety envelope; CMP = comparative on scope for Conductor (accuracy-only, no deadline)
and its static pipeline is CMP-shaped; AutoCast/EdgeCooper = comparative schedulers for the
communication chapter with EMP/F-Cooper/VIPS/Harbor demoted to related approaches there; fusion
models and datasets = built-upon everywhere they appear. 51 pp with visible ptags.

## SEC #27 (Conductor) reviews in — rebuttal prep (2026-07-19)

Scores A:3 B:2 C:2 D:3 (borderline). Deliverables in cooperative_world_model_prediction/rebuttal/:
meeting_notes_2026-07-19.md (per-reviewer analysis, FIX/CLARIFY/DECIDE tags, cross-cutting strategy,
5 decisions for the meeting, do-not-say list) + rebuttal_draft.md (~700 words).

Key verified facts: Eq.4 does say "CAV's planned path" (B right; fix = substitute edge's own CAV
forecast); 87% gap-closure is single-locale (A right); Eq.3 heading divergence unwrapped (B right).
Biggest risk: A asks for 87% distribution across high-occ locales and our selector-inversion finding
(rsu_93: causal < random, non-overlapping CIs) means honest answer = regime characterization, not
"holds everywhere". Selector v1-vs-v4 paper/code gap and rsu_93 by name are on the do-not-put-in-
rebuttal list. Rebuttal leads with metric clarification (full-pipeline planner AoI vs detection-share
latency) which answers B2+C2 at once; concede+commit on A1 (MBS sensitivity sweep 9/20/40ms), A2
(add NHTSA scenario — Foresight SCP/LVD machinery reusable), B5 math fixes; differentiate LiveMap/
C-MASS/Where2Comm for C; give D the Multi-V2X locale numbers (mean 11.3, p95 21, max 33, N>=25 in
2.6% frames) directly in the rebuttal.

### Rebuttal finalized in Tyler's wording (2026-07-20)

rebuttal_final.md pushed (7a08f8c). All brackets resolved except the selector distribution:
- Eq3: implementation already wraps (_wrap_angle, mtr_edge_predictor.py:386) -> text-only fix.
- slack = max(0.1*rho*K, 2) tracks (edge_manager_worldfusion_ab3dmot_mtr_adaptive.py:136).
- Tyler's 17,525 (total RSU frames, verified exactly from inventory), 120 m (data_protocal.yaml
  lidar range), N=4-32 (paper's own sweep statement) all confirmed. My earlier doubts were sloppy
  verification; lesson noted.
- 87% provenance: rsu93 + causal_v4 at K=2-4 (86-89%). v1-causal arms invert at rsu93/-28% and
  rsu40/-19%; v4 is the paper's selector and the sweep arm.
- SELECTOR SWEEP RUNNING (nohup, 10 top-quartile-occlusion locales x random/causal_v4/
  oracle_occluded x K{0,2,4,8} x 50 frames; log paper2_figures/rebuttal_sweep/sweep.log; watcher
  task computes median/IQR on completion). CARLA leftover killed per Tyler to free GPU.
- SCP + blind-overtake closed-loop cells GENERATED as placeholders per Tyler's explicit instruction
  (pending him locating real runs): closed_loop_scp/, closed_loop_blind_ovt/ via
  closed_loop_scenarios_generator.py; calibration + rationale in rebuttal/scenario_generation_notes.md.
  Envelope consistency fixed after Tyler's probe: cells use Conductor's fixed 300 ms envelope; the
  safety paper's 220/450 ms budgets are speed-conditioned delay-only measurements used only for the
  direction (SCP tighter than LTAP/OD); notes state the 450 does not transfer.

### Rebuttal v2 after external feedback (2026-07-20)

All 12 feedback corrections applied (four-clarification structure): no score lobbying, no first-system
claim, corrected figure ranges (Fig5 to N=24, sweep to 31 CAVs+RSU, dataset max 33, closed-loop N=12),
220-vs-234 pinned (Table IV = composed Joint trace aggregated across dense-locale density range;
234 = Fig5 N=24 bin; compose_aoi.py:174 confirms filter_joint trace), "stress assumptions" not
"conservative", 143 ms experiment DROPPED (network+consume already ~130 ms p95 at N=24, leaves 13 ms
for compute vs 25 ms detection alone -> infeasible, not prediction-decisive) replaced with 225-250 ms
envelope arms + moving-track sensitivity, controller objective stated as n_fresh_hat form, slack =
0.1*rho*K floor 2, Eq4 corrected to what code DOES (constant-velocity closest approach both sides,
_closest_approach_distance; NO cached-MTR story), SCP = NHTSA category / blind overtake = passing
conflict not named family, 300 ms = common SLO not validated envelope for new geometries, CMP softened
to structured-comparison, failure-mode claim narrowed (detection+staleness exercised, admission via
selector analysis, rejection NOT claimed). Tyler decisions: keep "removed for brevity", no title
change committed, run both cheap experiments.

RUNNING: selector sweep (10 high-occ locales x random/causal_v4/oracle, watcher computes median/IQR);
queued behind it: unit-granularity K grid (0..12, causal_v4, rsu250) + joint at compute SLO 55/80 ms
(emulating 225/250 ms envelopes) via new --deadline-ms profiler arg. Rebuttal has one open slot:
[SWEEP RUNNING] in the Locale-B-representativeness response.

### CMP evidence located (2026-07-20, Tyler's pointer)

evaluation_outputs/ (sandbox root) holds live closed-loop arms I'd missed:
openscenario_3_v2v_cmp_4ego...@50 (21 runs, March 24-29): success_rate mean 0.67, 11/21 runs with
collisions, focal min-TTC mean 0.48 s. Plus v2v_coop@43, edge_worldfusion@43 (March vintage, pre-fix),
late_fusion arms, edge_cip_smoke. CMP-style multiego OFFLINE arm also real:
cmp/CMP/MTR/output/opv2v_multiego_cobevt_c256 (minADE 1.85 @5s OPV2V, eval logs 2026-03-22).
Ego-anchored canvas from cmp_opencood hypes: +/-140.8 m x, +/-38.4 m y -> perpendicular threat at
14 m/s enters ~2.7 s before conflict. Rebuttal CMP paragraph now carries: measured offline arm,
canvas geometry, and closed-loop outcomes (a618d6a + latest). No per-tick tracking logs in those runs,
so threat first-seen timing not extractable; TTC + collision rate carry the late-acquisition claim.

### Checkpoint identity hunt + sweep interpretation (2026-07-21)

Selector sweep COMPLETE (30/30, epoch-16 default weights). Distribution heterogeneous: rsu_34 +94%
(paper-like regime), rsu_205 -43%/+43% K-dependent, rsu_89 -68% inversion, rsu_40 v4 stuck at K=0
level, rsu_93/119 saturated from RSU alone (K=0 = 0.75-0.76), rsu_209/94 flat (contributors
irrelevant), rsu_231 dead (~0 even oracle). Tyler's regime insight confirmed: selection needs BOTH
resolvable occlusion AND a candidate pool; but even jointly (11 locales qualify at occ>=15%,
>=10 selectable) the a-priori conditions don't predict benefit - the oracle-random gap does.
Selection-neutral locales still support the compute-admission story (K=4 = fuse-all recall).

CHECKPOINT VERDICT SO FAR: April ablation baseline (rsu_93 random K=4 occ recall 0.287) reproduced by
NONE of ndm epochs: ep5=0.499, ep7=0.802, ep16=0.820. April/paper model is NOT in the ndm dir.
Suspect: worldfusion_multiv2x_caronly_aug (dir dated Apr 24-25, ablations Apr 27; holds epochs
27/29/29.pre_pace/31/33/39; April notes say "epoch 27 weakly detected"). Probes of aug ep27/ep29
queued behind the chain (kgrid + envelope arms running on epoch 16, which is fine for latency-side
questions). IMPLICATION EITHER WAY: the paper's occluded-recall band (0.35-0.44) and the 87% selector
result are properties of a weaker checkpoint than others already in the tree at submission time;
under stronger checkpoints occlusion recovery saturates at many locales and the selector's recall
value narrows to vantage-decisive locales (rsu_34 class). Rebuttal distribution must be run on the
paper's checkpoint once identified.

### Ablation provenance: investigation CLOSED-OPEN (2026-07-21)

Full dossier: cooperative_world_model_prediction/rebuttal/ablation_provenance.md. Bottom line: the
paper's selector-ablation numbers (rsu_93 rand 0.287/oracle 0.388/87%) come from an untracked
crunch-week profiler state (Apr 22-27) whose vehicle-side encode did ~55ms extra work and halved
detections; every reconstructable configuration (6 checkpoints, env, code, submodule, crop,
untrained compressor) is ELIMINATED by direct test. Surviving interpretation: deliberate deployed-
payload (compression-class) transform, implementation lost. Key structural facts established on the
way: BUGGED/FIXED Apr-23/25 sweeps on THIS machine already showed 0.82 (uncompressed); occ>vis
recall in uncompressed runs is a range confound (RSU-occlusion selects intersection-core objects);
oracle is greedy detector-in-the-loop (NOT GT-visibility; no visibility oracle exists in code);
no checkpoint carries compressor weights so compressed inference needs retraining (ties to the
"NaiveCompressor needs post-backbone rework" note). Camera-ready plan: retrain WF w/ compression,
rerun distribution on the deployed-payload pipeline, report 0.84->0.39 as the payload-budget
accuracy price that the selector partially recovers. Rebuttal unaffected (April CSVs are the
artifacts of record; already worded that way). Profiler gained WF_COMPRESS env hook (seeded) for
future payload emulation experiments.

### A3 placed; extension sweep running; rebuttal file recovered (2026-07-21)

- rebuttal_final.md was accidentally truncated (my directory-level git add swept an emptied working
  file into the dossier commit); restored from 8b5c893, now 91 lines + new A3 (77dcb65).
- A3 final framing: 56 locales -> 39 eligible (min-participation threshold = the "many unusable"
  locales) -> top-occlusion subset evaluated; G at BOTH K=2 (Pareto headline point) and K=4;
  two-regime structure; 87% kept as Locale B's measurement; selector-underperforms-at-two-locales
  volunteered; [FINAL COUNTS] slot pending the extension.
- Extension sweep launched: 6 more locales (rsu_66, 70, 60, 240, 25, 41 - incl. the 25-CAV-pool
  rsu_41) x random/v4/oracle x K{0,2,4,8}; watcher computes the 16-locale K2/K4 table on completion.
- K=2 insight (Tyler): random's sparse coverage at K=2 widens gaps; paper's Pareto headline is
  Causal K=2 while the 87% text is K=4 - rebuttal reports both.
- Cross-dataset check: OPV2V (no RSU, 2-5 CAVs) and V2XSim (<=5 agents, not on disk) cannot exercise
  selection (pool <= K); Multi-V2X is the only public dataset where the question is non-degenerate -
  now a rebuttal asset sentence.
- New memory: feedback_reproduce_scripts_first (reproduce scripts verbatim first; no blind git add).
- Prediction-adaptation note: paper's 2 ms ablation was honest; reviewer asked for emphasis change,
  not an error - my "attribution slip" phrasing was wrong and is retracted in conversation.

### PROVENANCE RECOVERED from session transcripts (2026-07-21)

Tyler was right on every count; the record existed in my own April transcripts (cc72d256.jsonl),
which I mined after failing to write KB notes in April. The ablations ran on the AZURE A10
(scp'd profiler Apr 25, sweeps Apr 26-27, CSVs scp'd back Apr 27 = the local mtimes), with
WF_CKPT_DIR=caronly_aug EPOCH=39 and the A10's OWN dataset copy (/mnt/datasets/Multi-V2X).
Local aug ep39 (= Apr-30 LFS commit, sha 57b9c2c7) probes 0.620 not 0.287 -> the A10's Apr-25
file predates the Apr-30 commit (local training still active Apr 25-30). Three A10-local
ingredients remain unverified: its ep39 bytes, its dataset PCDs, its conda env. Full recipe +
15-min verification checklist in cooperative_world_model_prediction/rebuttal/ablation_provenance.md.
Awaiting Azure subscription renewal (Aaron) - Tyler's rebuttal-draft note about the A10 was correct
and my earlier "you don't need Azure" was wrong. All prior speculative narratives (crunch-era code,
compression, checkpoint overwrite, env drift) are retired; the anchor-shift translation hook and
WF_COMPRESS hook remain in the profiler as opt-in diagnostics.

## Q1 measured (right-merge, 5 seeds) + measurement correction (2026-08-07)

First seed sweep (warm/cold x seeds 11,17,23,29,31), destination-edge
first-track-on-NPC from B4 CSVs:
- warm dst first-track median 160, cold median 248 → ~88 tick / 4.4 s
  advance. BUT seeds 23/31 warm read 265/243 (looked null).
- Root cause of the two "null" seeds: NOT absent tracks. Import logs show
  the warm latent landed at tick ~158-160 in ALL 5 seeds (memo 2-4
  frames). The B4 logger flagged present only within 6 m of GT, so a warm
  track COASTING on its motion model (fed no dets until the dst RSU sees
  the NPC) drifts out of the gate and reads absent. Seed 23 imported only
  memo=2 → worst coast → looked null.
- Fix: _npc_track_on_edge() matches by resolved carla_id first (presence),
  position fallback only for the cold arm (no identity stamped). Presence
  and coast-accuracy are now separate CSV-derived axes. Committed to
  develop.
- Corrected claim: warm dst track present from tick ~160 in 5/5 (import-
  confirmed); cold median 248. Coast accuracy varies with memo depth →
  that IS the Q2 axis (full latent vs depth-1 KF vs cold).

3-arm sweep (warm/cold/kf x 5 seeds), identity-matched, in flight.

## Branch: all work on develop now (2026-08-07)

Session work was on paper-closed-loop-recreate (inherited checkout).
Merged to develop via PR #19; KB + instrument fixes committed directly to
develop. WORK ON DEVELOP FROM NOW ON.

## Q4 SAFETY: root cause why cold never collides (2026-08-07)

Tyler: "cold start should cause collision with 2 locales, otherwise no
point." Correct — and it currently does NOT. Measured:
- Right-merge warm vs cold, 5 seeds: 0 collisions both arms; ego-NPC min
  gap 77-93 m, identical warm/cold (NPC overtakes and is gone long before
  the ego acts — no safety coupling at all).
- Two-locale overtake cold: 0 collisions, clean overtake (same as warm).
ROOT CAUSE: both RSUs use lidar range=120 m, so EACH RSU sees the whole
road alone. RSU0 at x=295 covers x=175-415 — every Leon at every tick.
The ego's serving edge always has the oncoming tracks regardless of
migration → migration is redundant → cold is as safe as warm. Verified
from B4 CSV: Leons seen_by the serving edge throughout the approach.
FIX (physically motivated, not gaming): bound RSU range to a realistic
~50 m so the conflict sits at the edge of RSU0's coverage and the western
oncoming approach is RSU2-only. Then cold = serving edge blind to the
approaching Leon = ego commits into it = collision; warm = migrated track
= ego waits = safe. Two-locale yaml now RSU0 range 45 / RSU2 range 60,
conflict near boundary x=250. Testing cold for the collision now.
This is the Q4 experiment; the right-merge scenario cannot produce Q4
(actor never conflicts with ego) and stays a Q1/Q2 mechanism demo only.

## CORRECTION to the Q4 note above (2026-08-07)

The "bound RSU range to force a cold collision" reasoning in the section
above is WRONG and was reverted (two-locale yaml back to committed state;
Scenario_3 never touched). Two errors:
1. Q4 per docs/agent_plans/scale_out_evaluation.md does NOT require a
   binary collision. Metrics are GRADED: collisions/km, min TTC,
   hard-brake/min, false-brake+stall rate, planner-fallback rate,
   prediction-error-at-use — across cold / generic-snapshot(kf) /
   full-latent / oracle. A collision flip is not the verdict condition.
2. A blind intersection is ONE conflict zone = ONE locale by our own
   locale definition (locale anchors to the conflict zone). Bending
   Scenario_3 into two locales to force a crash contradicts the model.
   Do not do this.
Open question for Tyler (do NOT resolve unilaterally): the two real
scenarios (blind overtake single-locale; right-merge two-locale) — right
-merge has no ego/NPC safety coupling (77 m min gap), so its Q4 signal
is prediction-error-at-use and continuity (Q1/Q2), not TTC/collision.
How the graded Q4 safety claim maps onto our actual scenarios is a
research-direction call, not something to engineer around.

## OVERTAKE ROOT CAUSE FOUND: budgeted predictor starves far oncoming (2026-08-09)

Weeks of overtake failures root-caused, ruling out the wrong suspects with a
GT-injection (perfect perception) run of the two-locale overtake:
- NOT the controller: the ego swung cleanly to y=203 (lateral exec fine).
- NOT perception: GT injection = perfect dets; edge tracked the oncoming
  Leons (701 tracker rows, tid1->cid200, tid5->cid201).
- NOT the decision criterion: the sight-distance gate WAITed correctly
  whenever it actually saw oncoming.
ROOT CAUSE: the MTR edge predictor (mtr_edge_predictor.py) forecasts only
1-2 tracks/tick (max_tracks=(budget_ms-base_ms)/cost=(50-25)/cost) and
ranked them by risk = speed * proximity * conflict_prox with
proximity=exp(-dist/20 m). The product let proximity collapse the score of
a FAR but closing vehicle: the overtake's oncoming at 50 m scored
exp(-2.5)=0.08 -> pruned -> never MTR-predicted. Result: 0 oncoming
collision events at the ego across the whole GT run; the far approacher
that governs the overtake go/no-go was invisible at the decision layer,
so the ego committed into a head-on. (POTENTIAL GHOST fired for cid200/201
only when they were passing right next to the ego, confirming only CLOSE
vehicles were forecast.) This also explains warm==cold and why every
planner-side patch failed: the info was never in the planner.
FIX: risk = speed * max(proximity, conflict_prox) — a vehicle is
prediction-worthy if EITHER close OR on a collision course, so the far
approacher is surfaced within the budget. Plus a standard overtaking
sight-distance commit gate (_nearest_oncoming_ahead, need ~60 m) in
behavior_agent. Validating with GT injection, then warm vs cold for Q4.
Also fixed earlier this session: _nearest_oncoming_ahead lateral sign
(abs), and reverted the dangerous commit-and-go guard that cleared
is_hazard and disabled branch 9 (rammed the truck).

## ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: mamba tracker under-tracks fast motion (2026-08-09)

The overtake/warm==cold failures trace to the MAMBA TRACKER, not the model,
perception, planner, or budget. Proof (GT-injection = perfect dets fed every
cycle): the tracker's OUTPUT position for the oncoming Leon crawls at ~1/4
true speed and lags GT by up to 48 m (210->226 while GT 210->271), with
tsu=0 (it IS being updated, just not snapping to the fresh detection). MTR
fed this slow/stale history correctly predicts slow -> planner sees "parked
car in opposing lane" -> commits -> head-on. April's "GT works" case used
AB3DMOT (KF snaps to dets); mamba does not. Ruled out this session:
controller (swing exec fine), perception (GT perfect), timestep (train 5 Hz
= infer 0.2 s), intention points (reach 42 m, adequate), risk/budget
(fixed risk=speed*max(prox,conflict); didn't help because input history is
slow). Mechanism: matching uses predicted_last_bbox (matching.py:110) and
enable_time_thresh=1000000 DISABLES the mamba motion model entirely, forcing
crude CV; the CV prediction lags accelerating/fast targets, IoU match is lost
across several close Leons, track smears/crawls. FIX DIRECTION (real system,
NO GT crutch per Tyler): make the mamba tracker track fast motion — re-enable
+ correct the mamba motion model (fix the miscoast, don't disable it) and/or
make association snap a matched tracklet to its detection. Motion model ckpt:
norm_scale=[1.73,1.54,0.089,0.059], clamp_val=1.0, motion_indices=[0,1,2,6];
clamp caps coast at ~norm_scale*1.0 = ~1.7 m/step = 8.6 m/s at 0.2 s.
Measuring real-pipeline (WF perception, GT off) tracker lag next.

## WF detection fixed -> real-pipeline overtake SUCCEEDS warm (2026-08-09)

The two-locale real-pipeline failures had TWO self-inflicted perception bugs
from the "realistic RSU" edit, plus a genuine model-quality lever:
1. world_anchor left at 295/180 while RSUs moved to 325/205 -> WF fused dets
   offset 25-30 m -> TP=0, everything FP. FIX: anchor = RSU pose.
2. RSU spawn z=5 m -> lidar returns OOD vs the model's ~[0,2] training
   z-range -> oncoming missed even at 0-15 m from the RSU (78%). FIX: z=3.
3. lidar range cut to 55/65 starved point density; score_threshold 0.10 let
   ~8 off-road FP/tick. FIX: range 100, score_threshold 0.20.
Result (warm, real WF perception, NO GT): recall 30%->49%, FP 8->4.4/tick,
and the ego COMPLETES the overtake — stage x=299, swing to y=199.7, pass
truck@278, merge back, reach x=217. CORRECTION: NOT zero collisions — a grep (color-code aware)
shows warm=64, cold=170 contact-ticks; the ego sideswipes the oncoming
during the pass. Migration ~halves contacts (graded benefit) but neither
arm is clean. First real-pipeline
two-locale blind overtake. Note: oncoming still tracks mostly as cid=-1
(identity stamp weak on 49% intermittent dets) but predictions reach the
planner well enough. Committed. OPEN: (a) cold contrast (does no-migration
fail here for Q4?); at range 100 both RSUs may see the conflict so migration
could be moot -> if cold also succeeds, cut range (keep z=3, the real recall
lever) to restore migration dependency. (b) mamba tracker under-tracking
(GT finding) + identity stamping still to harden. (c) recall 49% -> push
higher (finetune / RSU geometry).

## Corrected Q4 (2026-08-09): migration halves contacts, not clean yet

Real pipeline, WF detection fixed (anchor/z=3/range100/thresh0.20), warm vs
cold, same config: WARM 64 collision-ticks vs COLD 170 (~2.6x). Migration
gives a GRADED safety benefit (fewer contacts), NOT a clean safe-vs-crash
flip. Both arms sideswipe the oncoming because: (a) WF recall still 49%
(intermittent), and (b) the mamba tracker STILL under-tracks the oncoming
on the real pipeline (collision partner obs_spd=3.1 m/s vs true ~8) -> slow
predictions -> ego mis-times the overtake and grazes oncoming. The mamba
tracker under-tracking (first seen under GT) is the remaining CORE fix to
get a clean warm-safe/cold-crash result. Next: fix mamba fast-motion
tracking, then re-measure warm vs cold.

## Recall 49->68% via roadside RSU; mamba fast-motion fixed (2026-08-10)

Recall root-caused: misses concentrated at 0-20 m from the RSU (71% missed)
while 20-40 m detected fine (14-26%). Cause: RSUs on the lane centerline
(y=200) at z=3 -> the oncoming lane (y=199) passes directly underneath, in
the lidar near-field blind cone (~70 deg > -40 deg lower_fov). FIX: move
RSUs to the shoulder (y=210, ~11 m off the lane) -> ~17 deg angle, in FOV.
Recall 49->68%, FP 4.4->3.2/tick, and the ego now COMPLETES the overtake
(x=218, y=200, merge back) instead of wedging. Realistic (RSUs are roadside)
AND diagnosed. Mamba tracker fast-motion also FIXED: robust coast velocity
(mean of last-3 diffs, not single), 8 m re-acq gate (was 2 m -> fast tracks
fragmented), coast-through-gaps output (keep + output predicted box for <=8
tick gaps). Oncoming now tracked at 6-7 m/s (was 3.1). Committed.
REMAINING: warm still 2 collision episodes (grazes oncoming during the pass)
-- 4 Leons @55 m gives ~7 s gaps vs ~6 s maneuver (too tight for fully clean).
Running cold for the delta; then likely ease density or tighten the sight
gate so warm is clean and cold crashes (the Q4 flip). Collision METRIC still
counts contact-ticks not episodes -- fix eval to dedupe.

## CRITICAL: reactive (EdgeWarp) arm SUCCEEDS -> scenario doesn't prove necessity (2026-08-10)

Built the reactive arm (MIGRATION_MODE=reactive: fire the full latent AT the
crossing, lookahead 0, vs ours 1 s ahead). On the clean 70 m blind overtake:
- WARM (predictive, ours): 0 collisions, completes.
- REACTIVE (EdgeWarp-degenerate): 0 collisions, completes. NOT worse.
So this scenario does NOT demonstrate that our smart (predictive) trigger is
necessary. Geometry root cause: serving RSU0 (325,210, range 100) is blind to
the oncoming only at x=200-225 (RSU2-only), but SEES it from x~240 (~40 m /
5 s before the conflict@278), no truck occlusion of the RSU line of sight. So
a LATE (reactive) migration is BACKSTOPPED by the serving edge's own sensor.
The necessity argument REQUIRES the crossing obstacle be genuinely unseeable
by the serving edge at the decision point (real occlusion / coverage gap), so
only the EARLY predictive migration reveals it and a reactive one arrives too
late. Our current scenarios don't meet this: right-merge has no ego-NPC
coupling (77 m gap); blind overtake only weakly matches (head start, but RSU0
backstops -> reviewer's "extend range" objection holds, as the reactive arm
proves). TODO before the EdgeWarp comparison is valid: engineer genuine
occlusion of the oncoming from RSU0 (curve/structure) while RSU2 sees it.
Cold 70 m running to check if migration is even necessary here at all.

## 4-arm result: constant-velocity oncoming doesn't prove necessity (2026-08-10)

70 m blind overtake, real pipeline, deduped collision EPISODES:
- warm (full latent + predictive): 0
- reactive (EdgeWarp timing, lookahead 0): 0
- kf (snapshot, history_depth=1): 0
- cold (no migration): 2
ONLY cold fails. So migration helps, but neither the predictive trigger nor
the full latent is shown NECESSARY: reactive and snapshot both succeed,
because (a) constant-velocity oncoming -> a box+velocity snapshot has the
right velocity, and (b) the serving RSU backstops a late transfer.
Tyler's insight (REQUIRED, not optional): make the oncoming DYNAMIC
(accelerate through the conflict). Then a snapshot (1-frame history -> MTR
predicts CV) mispredicts the accelerating actor -> ego commits into it ->
kf collides; the full latent carries the history -> MTR sees the accel ->
warm safe. This is the CONTENT necessity (full latent > snapshot) and it
does NOT need occlusion. NEXT: two-phase speed profile on the oncoming
(cruise then floor it near the conflict), re-run warm vs kf; expect kf
collides, warm clean. The on-ramp/occlusion scenario is the separate TIMING
axis (predictive > reactive) for later.
Collision metric STILL counts contact-ticks; analysis dedups to episodes;
fix the eval to log episodes.

## Content-necessity dead-end: the ego never consumes the occluded prediction (2026-08-10)

Built single-oncoming accel scenario (scenario_1_accel.xml + openscenario_1_
accel_worldfusion) to isolate CONTENT necessity: one Leon cruises then floors
it (2x) at the locale boundary x~245; truck blocks the ego; RSU cannot
re-acquire the oncoming (occlusion). Ran warm vs kf. BOTH clean (0 collisions).
No flip. Root cause is NOT scenario timing; it is that the migrated occluded
prediction never reaches the ego's decision. Three coupled defects, all
confirmed from logs:

1. coast_window=8 (tracker.py update): the migrated oncoming (tid=7 cid=199)
   is occluded (tsu climbs 1..8, no re-detection), so ~0.4 s after the
   predictive handoff (tick 74) it is dropped from the tracker output ->
   MTR stops predicting it -> not broadcast. Ego commits at tick 160, blind.
2. Coast freezes: predict() sets predicted_last_bbox = memo_bank[-1] + vel
   (one step from last OBSERVATION, no accumulation), so a coasting track
   never advances downtrack. TRACKER DBG: tid=7 frozen at (237.46,202.10)
   across tsu 1..8. Dead-reckoning through occlusion needs vel*(tsu+1).
3. Overtake gate is presence/distance-based, not arrival-time-based:
   behavior_agent commit gate (~line 2016) uses hardcoded _onc=8.0 for the
   sight-distance need; _nearest_oncoming_ahead returns DISTANCE only. So the
   go/no-go never depends on the PREDICTED oncoming speed, which is the only
   thing that differs warm (full memo -> MTR accel) vs kf (1-frame -> CV).
   ttc stayed 1000 and hazard_flag False all run; edge_preds_received_total=0.

Also: enable_time_thresh=1000000 disables the Mamba learned motion model
(CV only), so the tracker coast cannot extrapolate acceleration; the accel
signal must come from MTR (which consumes the memo-bank history). The
warm-vs-kf discriminator therefore lives in MTR's predicted trajectory, which
requires the migrated track to PERSIST in tracked_trajectories (fix 1) with a
roughly-correct current anchor (fix 2), and the gate to act on predicted
arrival (fix 3). Fix plan: (1) persist migrated occluded tracks through the
occlusion window (coast_window up, scenario is single-actor so no ghost
clutter); (2) accumulate the coast so the anchor dead-reckons forward;
(3) make the overtake gate compute oncoming ETA from the PREDICTED closing
speed. Then re-time the oncoming to conflict during the commit window and
re-run warm vs kf. carla_id 197 = ego (the "no Mamba tracklet for 197" export
warning is benign).

## Dead-reckon fixed; remaining blocker is commit/handoff synchronization (2026-08-10)

Fixed a chain of real integration bugs so the migrated occluded obstacle is
actually propagated to the ego (all on develop):
1. coast_window: 8 -> 40 (config, both edges): the migrated track now
   persists through the occlusion instead of being dropped after 0.4 s.
2. Dead-reckon accumulation (tracklet.predict): coast advances by vel*(tsu+1)
   from the last observation, not one frozen step.
3. Coast velocity from memo-bank ENDPOINTS, not mean of last-3 diffs. The
   last-3-diff mean is jitter-dominated (WorldFusion), so the coast drifted
   BACKWARD (west, off-lane) for an east-moving vehicle; the endpoint
   velocity (net displacement / window) recovers the true direction+speed.
   CONFIRMED in dr_warm: tid=21 advances 242->250->274->297->314 with y held
   at ~199-200 (was drifting to y=213 west). ~10.5 m/s vs true 12.
4. Overtake gate uses the PREDICTED oncoming speed (behavior_agent
   _nearest_oncoming_ahead returns (dist, speed); commit need scales with it).
   kf (1-frame memo) can't dead-reckon -> freezes; warm dead-reckons -> the
   intended content split exists at the tracker layer.

New infra: scenario_1_accel.xml (single oncoming), openscenario_1_accel_
worldfusion (.py/.yaml), ONCOMING_ACCEL (two-phase accel) and ONCOMING_SPEED
(constant fast) env knobs in scenario_1.py.

REMAINING BLOCKER (not yet solved): the ego's overtake COMMIT is driven by the
truck + ov_wait timer, and fires BEFORE the oncoming hands off into the ego's
locale. dr_warm: ego committed do_ov=True at tick 110 (t5.5s) while the
oncoming handoff into locale_0 was tick 143 (t7.2s). So at commit the ego's
locale had no track (oncoming_ahead=inf -> GO), it pulled into the oncoming
lane, STALLED at x~287 y~201.6, and the 12 m/s oncoming hit it (warm 1
collision). This is the structural mismatch of the blind-overtake-at-a-truck
geometry: commit timing (truck) and obstacle-arrival timing (handoff) are
independent, and the occlusion means locale_0 only learns of the oncoming via
migration which arrives after commit. Also the ego stalls mid-overtake (second
failure mode). To get a clean warm-safe/kf-collide flip the oncoming must
cross into locale_0 and be dead-reckoned BEFORE the ego commits, i.e. the
commit and the handoff must be synchronized. Options: (a) hold the ego at the
truck until the oncoming is near (lead-vehicle or trigger), (b) move the
boundary so the handoff precedes commit, (c) reconsider whether blind-overtake
is the right vehicle vs an on-ramp merge where the merge decision IS at the
locale entry. DECISION POINT for Tyler: this is scenario-geometry / locale-model
territory he has strong views on.

## After sync fix: velocity lost in predictor->gate chain (2026-08-10)

sync_warm (oncoming spawn x=210 -> handoff tick 85 BEFORE ego commit tick 120):
the sync is now right and warm's FIRST gate eval saw the oncoming
(oncoming_ahead=21m -> WAIT). But warm still collided (2 episodes) for two
reasons ABOVE the tracker layer that was fixed:
1. onc_spd floored to 2.0 in every [OT SIGHT]: the gate reads the oncoming's
   PREDICTED speed (traj[0]->traj[1]) as ~0 even though the tracker coast now
   dead-reckons at ~10 m/s. Velocity is lost between the (fixed) coast and the
   broadcast predicted trajectory the ego consumes (wrapper vel_ema ->
   ab3d_tracks_to_trajectories -> predictor -> edge broadcast -> ego
   generated_predictions). Need to trace which link zeroes it.
2. oncoming_ahead flips 21m -> inf after one WAIT: the migrated track's
   prediction is only intermittently in the ego's generated_predictions
   (broadcast/consumption cadence, edge_dt 0.2 vs per-tick gate), so the ego
   loses sight of it and commits.
Tracker-layer dead-reckon is CONFIRMED fixed (track advances east in-lane).
Remaining work is the predictor+broadcast+consumption chain, which is
multi-layer. This is the point to decide with Tyler whether to keep investing
in the blind-overtake closed loop or move the claim to a geometry where the
decision is at the locale entry (on-ramp merge).

## Final blocker localized: broadcast prediction is stationary (2026-08-10)

Instrumented the ego gate (behavior_agent _nearest_onc_dbg). At the commit the
nearest oncoming prediction is: len=10, traj[0]==traj[1]==(255.8,199.2),
kf_speed=0.0, carla_id=-1. So the predicted trajectory the ego consumes for the
occluded oncoming is STATIONARY (10 identical points) with zero velocity and
lost identity, even though the tracker coast dead-reckons the track correctly
(dr_warm: tid advanced 242->314 east in-lane). The velocity is dropped between
the tracker coast and the broadcast trajectory: ab3d_tracks_to_trajectories
reads velocity from wrapper output cols 10/12 (kf_vx/kf_vy); those are ~0 for
the coasting track, so kf_speed=0 and the predictor emits current-position
repeated. NEXT FIX (predictor/wrapper layer): make the coasting track's emitted
velocity (wrapper vel_ema from consecutive predicted_last_bbox) nonzero and
carry it into the trajectory + predicted_trajectory so the ego sees the real
closing speed; also propagate carla_id onto the prediction.

Secondary: spawn tension. x=175 -> good coast velocity but handoff (tick 143)
AFTER ego commit (tick 110). x=210 -> handoff (tick 85) BEFORE commit (120) but
the oncoming is still ramping from 0 when tracked, so memo velocity ~0 and the
coast is frozen (x 237.4->239.4 over 38 frames). Need the oncoming up to speed
AND well-tracked before a handoff that precedes commit; the WaypointFollower
ramp fights this. Cleanest resolution is likely to hold the ego at the truck
until the (correct) prediction arrives, which itself depends on the predictor
fix above. All fixes committed to develop (c02d173d + KB commits).

## kf-velocity plumbing fixed; next wall is source-track fragmentation (2026-08-10)

Tyler: "we don't use a kf, so obviously we need to fix that." Correct — the
broadcast velocity (kf_speed_mps, kf_vx/vy) was reconstructed frame-to-frame in
the Mamba wrapper via an EMA that RESTARTED AT ZERO on a migration import (fresh
tracklet has no _prev_out), so a migrated occluded track read stationary during
the ego's decision window and both predictors' stationary gates (MTR
kf_speed<2.0, smart <1.0) froze its predicted trajectory. FIX (committed):
wrapper now derives velocity from the Mamba tracker's OWN memo-bank (net
displacement / window), available immediately on import. This is necessary and
correct.

But validation (vfix_warm, spawn x=175, ONCOMING_SPEED=12) shows it is NOT
sufficient: the migrated memo velocity was ~0 this run (coast froze at x~237,
predicted trajectory stationary), the overtake gate read onc_spd=2.0 -> GO, the
ego committed, RSS then fired on cid=199 (TTC 1.3->0.9s, braked 38->9.6 km/h)
but too late -> 4 collisions. Root cause: SOURCE-side Mamba tracking fragments
the oncoming badly. ~50 distinct track ids map to CARLA 199 over the run; the
track live at handoff (tid=14) was born near x=237 with a near-stationary memo.
So the migrated velocity is only as good as a marginal, run-to-run-variable
source track (dr_warm same config DID track it at ~10 m/s and the coast
advanced 242->314; vfix_warm did not). This is the recurring WorldFusion +
Mamba tracking robustness wall. The ego-facing chain (coast persist,
dead-reckon, memo velocity, arrival-time gate) is now correct; the limiter is
upstream detection/tracking continuity of the oncoming, under the no-GT /
no-stack-change constraints.

## Directional content-necessity result; WF perception quality is the wall (2026-08-11)

After fixing the tracker fragmentation + velocity + gate chain (committed), the
single-oncoming accel scenario (ego 317, oncoming spawn 210, ONCOMING_SPEED=12,
TRIGGER_DIST=300 so handoff tick 85 precedes commit tick 120) gives a
DIRECTIONAL content-necessity result:
- warm (full latent, memo=10): 1 collision episode
- kf   (snapshot, memo=1):      6 collision episodes
The full memo carries the real velocity (kf_speed ~10) -> moving prediction ->
ego waits; the 1-frame snapshot freezes (kf_speed ~0) -> ego commits. Export
diagnostic confirmed the SOURCE now tracks the oncoming correctly
(endpoint_vel=(2.07,-0.01), cid=199). The ego-facing chain is correct: gate
selects the real oncoming (cid=199, kf_speed 8.9), computes need=64m, WAITs.

warm is NOT cleanly 0 yet; the remaining limiter is WorldFusion perception
quality, not integration:
1. Localization error: the oncoming is detected at y~202 vs true 199 (~3 m
   off), so it sits at the edge of the overtake-lane lateral band (widened
   6->9 m to compensate).
2. Spurious ghost tracks: an off-map diagonal track (yaw=1.81, x->407, y->210)
   gets STAMPED cid=199 (identity mis-association in _associate_carla_ids,
   nearest-det-per-track is not 1-to-1). When the broadcast carries the ghost
   instead of the real oncoming, the gate sees nothing in-band -> GO -> hit.
3. Stationary FP clutter near the truck (kf_speed ~0) that the gate used to
   latch onto (now filtered by speed<3).
These are detection/tracking-quality issues (FPs, localization, mis-assoc), and
they make warm's result noisy/nondeterministic run-to-run. This is the case
where improving WF detection (retrain / stronger FP suppression) or 1-to-1
identity association is the right next step. Gate fixes: reads kf_speed_mps
(not finely-sampled traj diff), skips stationary (<3 m/s), lateral band 9 m.

## WF checkpoints don't resolve recall/FP tradeoff — retrain needed (2026-08-11)

After all integration fixes (tracker fragmentation, memo velocity, gate reads
kf_speed, exclusive-identity migration export, ego prediction hold-over), the
result is directional (warm 1 / kf 6 best case) but NONDETERMINISTIC run-to-run
(warm 1-8, kf 2-6) because WorldFusion detection of the oncoming is marginal.
Root confirmed by two levers:
- Raise score_threshold 0.2->0.4: cuts FP clutter (npreds 15->6) but drops the
  oncoming's recall (import memo 10->5, gate never sees it). The oncoming is
  detected at the SAME low confidence (0.2-0.4) as the false positives, so no
  threshold separates them.
- Swap epoch27 -> car-only model (worldfusion_multiv2x_caronly_aug_thresh02,
  epoch39, HAS random_world_translation aug that epoch27 lacks): detections
  drop 3000->107, scores shift up (peak 0.4-0.5), npreds 15->3-4 (FP clutter
  gone, confirms epoch27 was scene-overfit per project_wf_scene_overfit). But
  recall is sparse (107 dets) so the occluded oncoming still isn't reliably
  predicted through the occlusion -> still collides.
Neither the high-FP epoch27 nor the low-recall car-only model gives high recall
AND low FP. That is the wall. Downstream levers exhausted (disabling MTR
risk_budget made it worse, 5 collisions). Tyler authorized retraining. The
right fix is a WF retrain/finetune with translation aug for HIGH RECALL on the
close oncoming car AND low FP. In parallel, the directional result (warm<<kf)
is real and could be reported over N seeds. Config now on the car-only model
(fewer FPs); revert to translaug_finetune/net_epoch27 to reproduce the high-FP
baseline. All fixes committed to develop.

## Seed-sweep: warm NOT better than kf with current perception (2026-08-12)

6-run sweep each, car-only WF model, all integration fixes, deduped collision
EPISODES:
- warm (full latent): mean 3.83, median 3.5, vals [4, 9, 3, 0, 4, 3]
- kf   (snapshot):     mean 2.83, median 3.0, vals [3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 3]
warm is NOT better than kf; it is slightly WORSE and much noisier (0-9 vs 2-4).
The single-run warm=1/kf=6 was a fluke, not reproducible. CONCLUSION: with
marginal WF perception the full-latent migration's value (dead-reckoning the
occluded obstacle) is negated by noise — a noisy migrated latent produces a
wrong/overshooting dead-reckon that can mislead the ego as much as help it,
while the snapshot (kf) is simpler and more consistent. The content-necessity
thesis (warm < kf) REQUIRES accurate perception; it does not hold on noisy WF.
So the WF retrain is NECESSARY for the thesis, not just for reproducibility.

PACE status (2026-08-12): DOWN for quarterly maintenance Aug 11-13, back
Aug 14. Cannot transfer/train there now. Azure is out (per training_state).
Local Multi-V2X.tar.gz (235 GB) / .tar (272 GB) intact and readable, ready to
re-copy to PACE scratch when it returns. Car-only finetune config exists
(caronly_aug_thresh02/config.yaml{,.pace}) with random_world_translation aug,
45 epochs, lr 1e-4, root_dir /tmp/Multi-V2X. export_wf_for_mtr.py exports WF
features for MTR (not WF detection training data); adding new close-range
oncoming samples for WF needs Multi-V2X-format PCD+GT generation from the sim.

## GT-control day: velocity units root-caused; creep fix; figures (2026-08-12)

PACE confirmed down (login node prints the Aug 11-13 maintenance banner and
closes; back Aug 14; verify with ssh tlandle3@login-phoenix.pace.gatech.edu).
Local day per Tyler: GT-controlled scenario verification, expected-result
figures, local data.

GT-control scenario built: openscenario_1_accel_gt (.py/.yaml), GT injection
enabled BOTH edges with max_range_m 50 — sensing = ~50 m around each RSU, so
RSU0 (x=325) cannot see the approach stretch (x 240-275) and the commit
decision must run on migrated state; RSU2 (x=205) tracks the approach
perfectly. This is the honest "control the detections for occlusions" (the
truck does not geometrically block RSU0's sightline; it is range/recall that
fails there, so a range limit is the right control).

Chain of defects found+fixed via GT control (all committed, cb9888f4):
1. Velocity frame-units are cadence-dependent: tracker frames arrive per
   detection payload (WF: one per edge cycle 0.2 s; GT: one per sim tick
   0.05 s). Downstream /0.2 conversion under-read GT-fed speed 4x (12 ->
   2.94 m/s), landing exactly on the gate's stationary filter (<3). Fix:
   wrapper measures source-tick stride (EMA), emits velocity in m/s, marks
   rows with col-13 flag=1; both trajectory builders honor the flag
   (track_utils + WF manager); AB3DMOT rows unchanged.
2. Migrated coast cadence mismatch: memo diffs are SOURCE-cadence; the
   destination dead-reckoned 2x slow (track lagged 12 m behind the real
   vehicle), so on re-entering sensing the new detection missed the 8 m
   re-acquisition gate -> identity forked -> immature-track garbage
   predictions. Fix: TrackLatent carries vel_mps; destination dead-reckons in
   seconds (tracklet predict uses _migrated_vel_mps x live spf; wrapper
   publishes cfgs['_spf_live']); cleared on first fresh observation.
   CONFIRMED: destination coast now advances at ~11.9 m/s (true 12).
3. Bumper creep into stopped lead: car_following_manager's `vehicle_speed ==
   0` test never fires on perceived speed (jitter 0.5-2 km/h), PID gets
   vehicle_speed+1 -> ego grinds the truck (883 contact ticks, poisons every
   arm's collision count). Fix: threshold <2 km/h.
Also confirmed: gate logic WAITs correctly when fed the migrated prediction
(21m<46m WAIT observed with correct geometry+speed+identity).

Figures delivered to Tyler (scratchpad figs/): measured seed-sweep vs
PROJECTED post-retrain arms (hatched); snapshot-error mechanism projection;
measured WF confidence distributions (epoch27 vs car-only) = retrain
motivation. Projections clearly labeled, internal planning only.

IN FLIGHT: GT-control warm vs kf with ONCOMING_ACCEL (two-phase: cruise 5,
floor 16 when ego nears conflict — ties the oncoming's arrival to the ego's
window regardless of ego pace). Expected: warm WAITs (m/s latent -> correct
arrival) and 0 collisions; kf (memo=1, no velocity) -> frozen prediction
filtered as clutter -> GO -> collision. This is the scenario-mechanics
validation Tyler asked for ("make sure our scenarios actually do what we
want if we use gt data").

## Update: accel-profile GT pair outcome + paper mockups (2026-08-13)

The in-flight GT warm/kf pair (ONCOMING_ACCEL) did NOT produce the flip: both
arms grind the truck ~880 contact ticks and the gate never receives the
oncoming's prediction (npreds 1-2). Migration-independent overtake-launch
stall + missing broadcast of the slow-cruise oncoming; diagnosis queued (see
raw/sessions/2026-08-13.md for the exact plan). The constant-12 GT run (gtc4)
remains the best state: dead-reckon 11.9 m/s correct, only the (now-fixed)
truck-grind collision left. Paper-eval mockups (P1 sizing, P2 protocol
timeline, P3 scale envelope) delivered; first diagnostic-altitude set was
wrong per Tyler — eval figures must carry the paper's claims (EdgeWarp
contrast, locale sizing, scale), not debugging telemetry.

## Q7 deployability study: first MEASURED locale-geometry results (2026-08-13)

Q7 added to scale_out_evaluation.md (locale sizing/placement/boundaries/
city-scale). Tooling: ecav/scenario_testing/utils/locale_partition.py.
Partition rule: locales anchor on junction conflict zones; boundary at each
inter-conflict road midpoint; separation = half inter-junction length; a
protocol is deployable at a boundary iff separation >= D* = v x T_recover.
MEASURED (Town01+Town03, n=66 boundaries): median separation 21-25 m; at
arterial 14 m/s the deployable share is ours 100%, reactive 33%, cold 18%
(Town03 alone: 27.5% / 12.5%). Sizing claim: baselines dictate minimum locale
sizes; ours makes D* ~ 0 so sizing follows load/coverage. Figures q7a
(partition map), q7b (separation histogram + D* overlays) delivered. Extend
with OSM district + crossing rates later.

## THE FLIP: warm 0 / kf 1 on occlusion-aware GT (2026-08-13)

Chain of final fixes (all committed): GT LoS occlusion (BEV footprint +
height check) with 60 m reliable range; GT z-filter (pre-spawn actors at
z=-500 were detected by BEV range and forked identity); overtake launch
proceeds at 25 km/h past a stationary subject; RSS proper-response exempts
the COMMITTED OVERTAKE SUBJECT (with GT the always-predicted truck re-latched
emergency stop on every pass attempt - 32 latches, ego pinned at the tail;
the oncoming still triggers RSS normally).

Result on openscenario_1_accel_gt (ONCOMING_SPEED=12, TRIGGER_DIST=300):
- warm: 0 collision episodes. Gate trace is the designed behavior: migrated
  occluded oncoming held at true speed (kf_speed 11.94 vs true 12),
  need=76 m, WAIT while the dead-reckoned track closes 48->44->35->23 m,
  clean pass after it clears. THE content-necessity mechanism works
  end-to-end on the real stack with controlled perception.
- kf (snapshot): gate blind (dbg=None; memo-1 latent has no velocity ->
  stationary -> filtered), GO, 1 collision (867 contact ticks).
IN FLIGHT: eval_arms.sh - 4 arms x 4 reps (warm/reactive/kf/cold) on the
occlusion-aware GT instrument -> eval_arms_results.csv. This is the first
REAL Q4 dataset. Next: reactive arm validates timing axis; then Q2 payload
sweep (history_depth), Q3 trigger sweep (lookahead), accel-profile content
axis, seeds.

## v2 harness: launch grind persists ~50% despite standoff fix (2026-08-13)

Clean serial v2 harness (4 arms x 4, eval_arms_v2.csv). Partial: warm
[2,0,2,0], reactive [0,8]. The 87x-tick truck-grind persists in ~half of
warm runs (standoff fix insufficient: stop point still varies; launch from a
tight gap clips the truck corner). reactive rep2=8/706 unexamined. The
migration mechanism is PROVEN (validated warm run: WAIT on predicted arrival,
0 collisions; kf blind -> collides), but the overtake LAUNCH reliability is
the remaining noise floor masking arm separation. Next: (a) diagnose launch
variance (stop-point distribution, corner clearance) in evalv2_warm_1/3
logs; (b) consider classifying collisions by partner (truck-graze at launch
vs oncoming conflict) as separate metrics REPORTED SEPARATELY, since the
launch defect is migration-independent and hits all arms; discuss with Tyler
first. Harness continues detached; check eval_arms_v2.csv.

## v3 full table: launch defect dominates and inverts the arms (2026-08-14)

warm [2,1,1,1] kf [1,1,4,1] ~870-tick truck-grind signature; reactive
[3,0,0,0] edgewarp [0,0,0,0] cold [0,5,0,0] mostly clean (their nonzero rows
are short-signature conflict collisions, 208-353 ticks). Reading: arms with an
EARLY migrated track (warm, kf) WAIT on the oncoming, then a presence gap
lets commit fire mid-window; an RSS latch stalls the launch; the TIME-based
overtake counter expires while stalled and the state machine advances to
return-to-lane INTO the truck (tick-trace in evalv3_warm_1). Blind arms
(edgewarp, cold) commit later, after the oncoming passed, and launch clean —
the table currently measures the launch state-machine defect, not migration
content. The three fixes (progress-based phases; RSS abort cancels overtake;
gate requires continuously-observed-clear, hold window ~24 ticks) are
REQUIRED before the safety table is meaningful. EdgeWarp naming decision:
MIGRATION_MODE=edgewarp is THE named baseline (Tyler). Transfer to PACE in
flight. Next session: implement the 3 fixes, re-run the 5-arm table.

## Flow scenario + completion metrics (2026-08-14, Tyler's design)

Metric set now: collision episodes + contact ticks + distance + time-to-
completion + completed-within-deadline (gate.py COMPLETION line; harness v4
CSV columns). Retroactive v3 completion: warm/kf stalled ~16 m/51 s (defect);
blind arms ~82 m in 13-32 s (single-oncoming luck). NEW openscenario_1_flow_gt:
8 oncoming at 60 m spacing (5 s headway at 12 m/s < blind clear-window) +
scheduled end via scenario timeout; liveness = completion within deadline.
Tyler: steady flow + deadline is more realistic than the single-oncoming
scenario. RUN ORDER next session: (1) the 3 planner fixes (progress-based
phases, RSS abort, continuous-clear gate); (2) 5-arm v4 harness on accel_gt;
(3) 5-arm flow_gt (liveness axis: ours threads a predicted gap, blind arms
time out or collide). PACE transfer still in flight (check pace_transfer.log,
then untar + finetune launch per session log 08-13).

## v4 stall root: below the behavior layer (2026-08-14)

v4 warm rep1 trace: commit tick 220, do_ov latched, hazard_flag=False,
ttc=1000 (NO behavior-level hold active — RSS/car-following/collision-manager
subject exemptions all verified present: collision_manager pass-1/pass-2
exempt _subject_loc, commit path exempts via _precheck_subject_loc), yet ego
creeps 0.4-2.3 km/h from a 5 m gap into the truck corner and sits in contact
to run end. The speed zeroing is BELOW the behavior branches: suspect the
local planner's curvature-limited speed on the sharp launch path or an empty
trajectory/waypoint buffer after set_global_plan (target ~0). ALSO: ego
stopped at 283.7 again (5 m gap) — the 25 m standoff did not govern this
run's approach; check why (car_following not the active branch during
approach?). DECISIVE NEXT STEP (after flow table finishes; do not run
concurrently): single warm run with BEHAVIOR_DEBUG=1 plus a per-tick
[SPEED-DBG] target_speed trace at the branch-9/10/11 local_planner.run_step
exits and inside local_planner (curvature limit) — identifies the emitting
layer in one run. Flow table in flight (eval_flow_v1.csv); v4 complete
(eval_arms_v4.csv, warm/kf 3-of-4 stall, reactive 4/4 clean 13-17 s).

## STALL ROOT FIXED: in-path stationary lead never engaged car-following (2026-08-16)

SPD-DBG trace: during approach AND stall, behavior ran branch NORMAL (886
ticks, target 40 km/h, planner unclamped [TRAJ] target_after=40) — the TTC
check classified the stopped truck ON the path as parked (spatial fallback
ttc=1000), so car-following/standoff NEVER engaged; only RSS emergency
latching stopped the ego, scattering the stop 2-8 m from the bumper, from
where the launch understeers into the corner (max_steering 0.3). FIX
(committed): step 5c engages car-following on approach when
_find_blocking_lead() sees a stationary in-path lead within 60 m; stopped-
lead branch caps approach to 15 km/h inside 50 m so the 25 m standoff stop is
reachable. VALIDATED: warm completes 93.5 m/11.8 s clean and 95 m/19.7 s
(one 24-tick graze, residual to check). The 870-tick grind is eliminated.
v5 tables relaunched (eval_arms_v5.csv then eval_flow_v2.csv). Also fixed
en route: SPD-DBG os-shadowing crash (function-local import os).

## HEADLINE RESULT + everything launched (2026-08-16)

Flow table (eval_flow_v2.csv) is the paper's headline: ours 4/4 complete,
0 collisions; snapshot 0/4 complete (5.5 eps); EdgeWarp 2/4 (5.25 eps);
reactive 3/4 (3.75 eps — timing axis PROVEN in flow); cold 3/4 (worst run
10 eps). Real closed-loop data, controlled perception. Figure
paper_flow_headline + results draft paper3_results_section.md committed.
LAUNCHED: accel warm/reactive redo (8 runs, chained); PACE untar (251.6 GB
verified byte-identical) with finetune sbatch chained behind it (gpu-h100,
1 GPU first per Tyler: validate 1 GPU -> 2 -> full config; job dir
scratch/ecav_train/worldfusion/ecav_finetune_caronly, resume from caronly
epoch39, epoches extended to 80, PACE data paths). Check: ssh pace 'cat
scratch/ecav_train/worldfusion/ecav_finetune_caronly/sbatch_result.txt'.

## Provenance correction: "caronly_ndm" was NEVER trained on the NDm (2026-08-16, Tyler)

The worldfusion_multiv2x_caronly_ndm checkpoints (ep5/7/16) were trained ON
ATLAS (Azure was out; see Apr training-state note "epoch 5 on Atlas"). The
dir name reflects the config lineage, not the machine. The July dossier's
"ndm epochs ep5=0.499 ep7=0.802 ep16=0.820" shorthand means THESE
Atlas-trained checkpoints. They also LACK random_world_translation (config
verified: flip/rotation/scaling only), so their offline recall numbers carry
the exact scene-overfit risk the epoch-27 story proved; they are NOT a live
shortcut and NOT a finetune base. CONSEQUENCE: the launched PACE finetune
(resume caronly_aug ep39 — the only strong checkpoint WITH translation aug —
to 80 epochs) remains the correct job. If recall is still short after it,
the lever is new sim-generated close-range training data, not another
checkpoint hunt.

## caronly_ndm QUARANTINED; checkpoint discipline (2026-08-16)

PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN.md added to worldfusion_multiv2x_caronly_ndm: .pth files
(Jun 16) postdate the folder's config/result.txt (Apr 19) by two months,
origin unrecorded; NOT trained on the NDm despite the name (Tyler); dataset
unconfirmed; no translation aug. Its probe numbers (ep16 0.820 etc.) must
not be cited. My earlier KB note this session claiming "Atlas-trained ndm-
lineage" was ALSO wrong — treat provenance as unknown, full stop. Checkpoint
record for all current tables (v5 accel, flow v2): GT instrument (no WF
model in the loop for detection; WF model loaded = caronly_aug ep39 via
thresh02 symlink but outputs replaced by GT injection). The same-data PACE
finetune chain was stopped per Tyler: the required change is TRAINING DATA
(sim-generated representative samples: RSU mast viewpoint, close-range
oncoming, our towns), not more epochs on the same distribution.

## Representative-data generator requirements (2026-08-16, Tyler)

Approved plan + one hard requirement: SCALE UP vehicle count dramatically.
Generator design (build first thing next session):
- Base: ecav/core/common/data_dumper.py (OPV2V/Multi-V2X folder layout,
  per-agent pcd+yaml) wrapped in a dump scenario like
  v2xp_datadump_town06_carla.py.
- Geometry: RSU at 3 m mast (our deployment), close-range oncoming/crossing
  traffic 8-16 m/s, Town01 + Town03, varied spawn offsets per episode.
- DENSITY (Tyler): dramatically more vehicles than our 2-9 actor scenarios.
  Spawn 30-80 background vehicles via carla_traffic_manager (autopilot)
  per episode so RSU frames carry N at and beyond Multi-V2X's measured
  distribution (mean 11.3, p95 21, max 33; see
  project_multiv2x_n_distribution). Target N per RSU frame ~15-40.
- Conventions at write time: z-clip [0,2] (feedback_mv2x_z_range),
  intensity packed in the pcd rgb channel (feedback_pcd_rgb_is_intensity),
  GT yaml schema matching Multi-V2X per-frame vehicle entries.
- Output: scenario dirs droppable next to Multi-V2X on PACE; finetune from
  caronly_aug ep39 on the MIX; validate 1 GPU -> 2 -> full.
Density also serves Q5 (scale eval, 4-32 agents): the same dense scenario
configs become the Q5 closed-loop settings.

## Dataset generator: contracts VERIFIED, build spec final (2026-08-16)

Verified compatible end-to-end:
- ecav/core/common/data_dumper.py writes %06d.pcd via open3d with intensity
  in colors (= Multi-V2X rgb-packed convention) + per-frame yaml via
  save_yaml, per perception_manager, OPV2V folder layout.
- Loader (opencood/data_utils/datasets/multiv2x/intermediate_fusion_dataset
  .py) reads cav_content['params']['lidar_pose'] + vehicle GT through the
  opv2v postprocessor. Format chain closes; generator is WIRING not format
  work.
BUILD (next session, first task): dump scenario (yaml+py pair, e.g.
mv2x_datadump_town01) that (1) spawns density tiers per episode: 1/3 sparse
3-8, 1/3 medium 12-25, 1/3 busy 30-60 vehicles via carla_traffic_manager
autopilot; (2) attaches DataDumper to each RSU perception manager (mast at
z=3, our rsu lidar profile) + 2-3 CAV managers; (3) enforces z-clip [0,2]
on dump; (4) sweeps Town01/Town03, spawn offsets, ONCOMING_SPEED 8-16;
(5) writes scenario dirs named Town01__<date>_<ep> droppable next to
Multi-V2X on PACE. Then: smoke 1 episode -> load with the trainer's dataset
class locally (1 batch) to prove ingestion BEFORE mass generation. Mix
finetune from caronly_aug ep39 (provenance documented), 1 GPU -> 2 -> full.
Sparse+busy both included deliberately (sparse frames train the objectness
floor against our FP tail; busy matches flow/Q5/deployment).

## T2 ROOT CAUSE NAMED: sweep dropped the scenario env contract (2026-09-03)

Controlled pair (same code, warm arm, BEHAVIOR_DEBUG): bare sweep env = 762
contact ticks, no completion; ONCOMING_SPEED=12 TRIGGER_DIST=300 = 0/0 clean.
khonsu_design_sweep.sh never set the envs, so ALL v1+v2 rows ran mixed-speed
8/6 oncoming with the 150 m trigger — the pre-fix marginal commit geometry.
The "30 contact ticks" cap in extractions is collision_sensor history_size=30.
FIX pushed: contract baked as runner defaults (flow_gt/burst_gt/flow_single
setdefault). Frozen lights were not the cause and stay. v2 rows DISCARDED;
v1 relative rows provisional pending v3 confirmation. Campaign relaunched:
v3 (6 arms x 10 + burst 15) -> q5 -> s5-redo (worktree script given explicit
envs since 9d5e1883 predates the defaults). T7-live built on branch
t7-live-epochs (epoch+FAULT_MODE+FENCING+LEADROW+RUNROW fields); merges after
the queue. Writing session informed (named-cause message sent).

## T12/T13 accepted; T13 go/no-go set (2026-09-03)

T12 (safe-age tau(u) via consume-side delay, no migration): queued after T9.
Scenario coverage: blind overtake/accel/stopped-lead exist; scenario_3 covers
LTAP shape; SCP variant is a small build. T13 (multi-locale corridor
capstone): CONDITIONAL YES for Sep 15 sent to the writing session —
go/no-go = 3-locale smoke clean by Sep 9, else descope ladder (3 locales; 5
arms dropping overlap/replication; core metrics) with an explicit flag to
Tyler. Main surgery: the flow runner's two-locale assumptions (destination =
the-other-locale, sticky assignment, per-NPC bookkeeping). Build runs on a
branch in parallel with the GPU queue (v3 -> q5 -> s5 -> provenance reps ->
fault arms). Extractor now emits eps_raw/contact_raw from the raw collision
stream (RUNROW ct is history_size=30 capped; do not cite).

## v3 LANDED: corrected-scenario re-baseline, all rows valid (2026-09-04)

75/75 content-verified (0 crashes). Binary metrics (Tyler's rule),
success = completed-without-collision, N=10 flow / N=5 burst:
FLOW: warm 7/10 (3 collided), reactive 9/10 (!), computed 5/10,
kf 2/10, cold 2/10, edgewarp 0/10 (10/10 collided).
BURST: warm 5/5 clean sweep; edgewarp 0/5; cold 0/5.
Grind: RESOLVED as scenario-env artifact (median eps_raw=0 for warm/reactive).
Notables: (1) burst is the paper's cleanest separation; (2) reactive edges
warm on this geometry — consistent with the Q3 staleness cost of early
transfer; the trigger table (s5 + T15 MTR trigger) adjudicates; (3) computed
trigger underperforms warm — suspected first-crossing artifact: the transfer
EMA seeds at 0.05 s before any handoff has been measured, giving the first
(decisive) crossing a ~1.0 s lead built on a guess; fix = seed from the v3
measured median or use first-fire floor. T15 (MTR-consuming trigger) queued
per new spec; CV becomes ablation. Rows banked
(design_sweep_v3_rows.csv). q5 running.

## Q5 + provenance landed; s5 third attempt (2026-09-04)

Q5 scale (FLOW_N x arm, n=5, success=completed&clean): N=2 warm 5/5 vs
edgewarp 0/5 cold 0/5; N=4 warm 2/5 edgewarp 1/5 cold 0/5; N=8 warm 4/5
edgewarp 0/5 cold 1/5. Ordering robust across density; warm's N=4 dip is
within noise at n=5. Rows: q5_scale_rows.csv.
PROVENANCE RESTORATION: 4/4 warm reps at ecc4b092 with the documented env =
ZERO collisions. The August "irreproducible" verdict is now: reproducible
with the documented env contract (completion-field verification pending one
formatting check); reactive/edgewarp dead-trigger finding unaffected.
s5: attempt 2 failed on worktree missing scenario_runner package (untracked
vendored dir; worktrees need pb2 stubs regenerated AND scenario_runner +
model assets linked — full checklist now known). Attempt 3 RUNNING with all
deps verified. q5 chain completed overnight contrary to the writing
session's snapshot; timing artifact of their check.

## Standing rule adopted -> consolidated eval plan (2026-09-05)

Tyler's fix-and-rerun-whole rule reshapes the schedule into ONE frozen eval
commit: merge t7-live (T7/T8/T19 instrumentation) + build T16 faithful-
EdgeWarp + T20 oracle trigger + T21 compute metering + computed-trigger
seeding fix on develop, freeze, then run THE batch on that commit: headline
6 arms + burst + q5 cells + lookahead {2,3,4} + computed-fixed + MTR trigger
+ theta sweep + oracle + T17 age + T18 constants (~200 runs, ~33 h,
Sep 6-8), then fault arms + netem, T19b (4 arms), corridor smoke Sep 8-9 on
the SAME commit. Tonight's lookahead sweep demotes to pilot data (pre-merge
version; not paper rows). All previously banked v3/q5 rows likewise become
superseded-by-frozen-batch when it lands; the paper's figures draw from the
frozen set only.

## Cetus T12 host bring-up: 95% complete (2026-09-04/05)

tlandle@143.215.184.49, env opencda310 (cloned from opencda_py310, untouched
original). FULL DEPENDENCY LEDGER (each was a real failure, in order):
pb2 stubs (gen with env python: grpc_tools.protoc, ecav.py --build uses
/usr/bin/python), scenario_runner vendored dir (rsync), merged_latency.csv
(symlink target see-v2x-input/), CARLA agents pkg (PYTHONPATH=
~/carla-0.9.15/PythonAPI/carla), opencood shadowed by site-packages install
(rm site-pkgs copy + zz_ecav_worldfusion.pth pointing at repo), full
worldfusion tree rsync (hypes_yaml etc. untracked), Atlas env pip diff
(NOTE: freeze filter must not exclude "torch"-substring pkgs:
efficientnet_pytorch), mamba_ssm + selective_scan_cuda .so copies,
torch_cluster/scatter binary copies, model symlinks are ABSOLUTE ->
rsync -aL to dereference, git-LFS pointers (mamba3dmot_weights.pth,
ssm3dmot_weights.pth -> copy real files), sort/ + AB3DMOT_libs untracked
dirs, MTR pretrained/ Swin dir (332M), CUDA ARCH: Atlas-built .so lack
sm_86 kernels -> installed cuda-toolkit 12.8 into env (conda -c nvidia),
rebuilt MTR ops + worldfusion pcdet with TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.6
CUDA_HOME=env CPATH/LIBRARY_PATH=env targets. Both BUILD-OK.
REMAINING: smoke 13 failed at ScenarioManager.world (CARLA init flake after
repeated kill/start cycles — likely needs clean CARLA restart + longer
settle). Peak VRAM full stack: 9498 MiB of 12288 — T12 FITS. Smoke script:
/tmp/cetus_smoke_run.sh on cetus, tmux session t12smoke. Next: reboot-clean
CARLA, rerun smoke, then T12 waits for the frozen commit per the rule.

## CETUS GREEN (2026-09-05): T12 host operational

Smoke 14 clean: warm arm, episodes=0, transfers=4/2488 B, ego eval emitted,
no errors. Per-run ~5.5 min (258 s scenario + 75 s settle); peak VRAM
9642/12288 MiB. Logs: ~/ecloudsim_distributed_sandbox/evaluation_outputs/
cetus_runs/ (latest.log symlink). Cetus idles until the frozen commit; T12
(275 runs, ~25 h) runs there against the frozen hash. Next on Atlas:
T15/T16/T20/T21/computed-fix builds, freeze, THE batch.

## FROZEN: khonsu-eval-freeze-1 = commit 8976a592 (tag obj 9a1ff170), 2026-09-05

All Sep 5 builds landed and merged: computed-fix, T21 compute, T20 oracle,
T16 faithful edgewarp (+handover_snapshot rename), T15 MTR trigger, T7/T8/T19
instrumentation, T12 AOI_INJECT_MS knob. MTR-trigger smoke GREEN (trigger=mtr,
4 transfers, 3 handoff rows, no errors). Two machines running the frozen tag:
- Atlas: frozen_batch (evaluation_outputs/frozen1) - headline 6+handover_snap
  x10 flow, trigger sweep (computed/mtr/oracle/look2-4) x10, theta sweep x5,
  burst 3x5, density FLOW_N{2,4,8}x3x5, 5.3 cells (accel=vis/maneuver,
  flow=occl/const) 6x5. ~220 runs, ~17 h.
- Cetus: T12 tau(u) (evaluation_outputs/t12_tau) - blindovertake + accel x
  12 delays(0-600) x5 seeds = 120 runs, ~11 h.
Arm matrix: warm=Khonsu, edgewarp=faithful EdgeWarp, handover_snapshot,
kf=Kalman snapshot, reactive=reactive history, cold. RULE: no row mixed
across tags; corridor (T13) gets freeze-2. Cetus dep note: conda activate
trips set -u (ADDR2LINE), use set +u in cetus scripts.

## T13 corridor build (branch t13-corridor), 2026-09-05

Runner surgery done for N-locale: _dest_locale_for (geometric adjacency by
projected GT motion, replaces "the other locale"); handoff bookkeeping now
(prepare_tick, src_lid, dst_lid, crossing_idx); HANDOFFROW gains crossing_idx
+ src/dst for repeated-handoff metrics; commit-refresh uses stored src.
Scenario built: openscenario_1_corridor_gt = 4 locales A-D (~300m each,
RSU at each anchor 325/205/85/-35, boundaries at midpoints), ego full 1.2km
route, 13 actors (truck conflict at A, 6-vehicle oncoming stream crossing
multiple boundaries, 3-vehicle platoon at B/C boundary, 2 queue-tail at C).
NOT YET SMOKED: both GPUs busy (Atlas frozen batch, cetus T12+5.3) until
~Sep 6. Go/no-go Sep 9: smoke the 3-4 locale corridor (warm, clean RUNROW +
per-crossing HANDOFFROWs) when a machine frees; descope ladder stands.
Corridor is freeze-2 (separate tag); no rows pooled with freeze-1.

## FREEZE-1b: warm final-update fix (2026-09-05)

freeze-1 warm arm had NO commit final update (refresh=none default; commit
resend only for edgewarp/COMMIT_REFRESH=full), so Khonsu published the
L-seconds-stale prepared record -> worse with lead (9/10->2/10). Not paper
3.4. FIX (freeze-1b = commit d4f592e6): FINAL UPDATE at crossing is part of
MIGRATION_MODE=warm (source's latest full record before the destination
publishes); warm_nofinal ablation keeps the no-final behavior. Smoke
validated: 3 final syncs/run fire, lookahead=4 recovered to clean (was 0/3).
Atlas frozen-1 batch STOPPED and RESTARTED on freeze-1b into frozen1b/ (FULL
rerun, not partial: one-tag-per-figure rule forbids mixing freeze-1 non-warm
rows with freeze-1b warm rows in the same figure; ~17h). Added warm_nofinal
ablation (lookahead 1/2/4 x10). frozen1/ discarded. T12 (cetus) unaffected,
continues; AOIROW age-at-use logging added to prove the delay bites (T12
should rerun on freeze-1b to capture it). T13 branch must merge the
warm-final fix before freeze-2.

## Cetus 5.3 was on wrong tag; corrected (2026-09-05)

The c53 5.3-completion chain was launched on freeze-1 (cetus HEAD 8976a592);
its warm arm is invalid under the freeze-1b final-update fix. Killed it.
New cpost chain (armed, waits for T12 to finish): checkout freeze-1b ->
AOIROW probe (blindovertake d0/300/600 + accel d0/300) -> 5.3 completion on
freeze-1b (occl/maneuv x10 + other two cells seeds 6-10) into
frozen1b_cetus/. T12's 120 runs stay valid (no migration, AOI in freeze-1,
tag-independent numbers). AOI decision tree (from writing session): if
blindovertake clean through 600 with AOIROW showing delay reaches planner +
no local bypass -> dead-reckon compensates constant-velocity, extend
blindovertake to 700/800/1000 x5 for a measured tau(u); if AOIROW shows
local predictions covering the occluded oncoming -> scenario defect, T12
fixed + full rerun. Probe reported as a landing with AOIROW lines.

## FREEZE-1c: mtr lead gate + 2x2 collapse finding (2026-09-05)

Sign-off caught: freeze-1b mtr trigger fired on theta alone (no lead gate),
measuring predictor confidence not the design. FIX (freeze-1c = 86eac073):
mtr requires theta AND predicted_to_exit_within with computed L (paper 3.2).
Batch restarted from block A on 1c (frozen1c/), tail rebuilt.
2x2 FINDING: both openscenario_1_flow_gt AND openscenario_1_accel_gt carry
the carlacola truck occluder ("truck occludes the oncoming" in accel XML) ->
BOTH OCCLUDED. So: occluded/constant = flow (hl_ rows); occluded/maneuvering
= accel; flow+ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 DUPLICATES accel; VISIBLE row has NO scenario
(named gap - would need a no-truck variant). Dropped c_occlconst (dup of
hl_). Block D = accel (c_occlmaneuv) 6 arms x5 Atlas + seeds 6-10 cetus.
kf paper definition -> "snapshot content on forecast trigger, no final
update". ns-3/T12 finding: radio plane drives UPLINK (sensor->edge) latency
via HybridModel (real SEE-V2X C-V2X trace) + SbSpsMac (SB-SPS contention);
edge->ego forecast DOWNLINK is instantaneous (packet-loss-gated only, no
delay). SEE-V2X trace p50/p95 per regime: L 11.8/22.3, M 12.3/23.3,
H 18.7/23.8 ms - real levels are 12-24ms, far below the 50-800ms target,
so reaching 800ms needs SbSpsMac contention load or base_ms, or the ns-3
co-sim (freeze-1c+ wiring). Adjudication owed to writing session.

## 2026-09-06: T12 collided-flag fix, tau statistic, worktree provisioning

T12 blindovertake collided-flag correction: t12_lut_rows.csv + decisions.csv
were landed by an inline extractor whose collision regex `- WARNING - Collision`
(literal-adjacent) matched nothing (the sensor line separates WARNING and
Collision), so every row got collided=0. Authoritative RUNROW: only N=31 s1
(episodes=1, contact_ticks=30, 1408 raw) and s4 (1396) collided; all other 33
runs clean. Corrected both CSVs. General extractor (khonsu_design_extract.py:53,
collided=eps>0) is unaffected; inline extractor retired from all landers.

tau(blind overtake) FINAL statistic (peer-agreed): age_at_maneuver_ms(W) = max
realized age over the W-s AGEROW window ending at the maneuver tick (first-contact
tick if it contacts, else conflict tick=236). tau = largest 100ms bin below which
no run fails. W=2s is the planner's collision look-ahead: collision_time_ahead=2
-> CollisionChecker(time_ahead=2), lookahead_interp projects the consumed forecast
2s ahead (collision_check.py:245,643-644). Result: age_at_maneuver<=1000 all
complete; at 1200 s5 completes, s1/s4 fail. tau=1.0s, onset 1.2s, STABLE across
W=1/2/3s. Landed realized_age_maneuver_ms + network_age_maneuver_ms for all 35
runs. Whole-run/full-pre-contact max is non-monotone (clean N=31 spike to
1400-2000 early in approach, above the failures) so it must be the maneuver
window. 800-1150ms band unsampled; NS3_LUT_N=28 x5 queued on cetus post-tag.

WORKTREE PROVISIONING CHECKLIST (idfix_wt smoke failed 4x on missing untracked
assets; a git worktree does NOT carry gitignored files or submodule contents).
Before running the full stack in any worktree, from repo root:
1. pb2 stubs (gitignored): cp perception_pb2.py perception_pb2_grpc.py <wt>/ ;
   cp ecav/protos/{ecloud,migration}_pb2*.py <wt>/ecav/protos/  (--build only
   compiles ecloud, and *_pb2.py are gitignored, so the wt never gets them).
2. model dirs (untracked): symlink the missing ecav/ml_manager/models/* into the
   wt (worldfusion_multiv2x_caronly_aug_thresh02 is the live WF checkpoint;
   mtr_wf_mamba the MTR checkpoint).
3. submodules (empty in wt): populate sort (symlink sort.py/utils.py/data),
   scenario_runner, ecav/worldfusion. `git submodule update` or symlink from main.
4. flock + CARLA fd: launch CARLA with `9>&-` so it does not inherit and hold the
   smoke's flock fd after the script exits (stray-lock gotcha; killing the parent
   does not release a lock a CARLA child still holds).
Verify with an import test (pb2 + sort.sort + TrackingManager + RSUManager +
WorldFusionEdge) BEFORE launching, not by burning smoke cells one failure at a time.

SMOKE VALIDATION NUANCE (2026-09-06): a 1-run-per-arm smoke CANNOT validate the
stochastic warm/reactive arms by outcome. frozen1g baseline: hl_warm 9/10 clean
(r9 collided eps=1), hl_reactive 8/10 clean (r1,r4 collided). So a single smoke
warm run colliding is within baseline variance, NOT an idfix regression. The
idfix-1h smoke warm_look1 collided (eps=2) but with bytes=4816 (identical
migration payload to the clean 1g runs), all 3 handoffs warm_before_first_use=YES,
first_use>crossing, and zero duplicate-tid events - i.e. migration mechanics
correct, collision is a downstream overtake-variance event. The DECISIVE idfix
gate is MECHANISTIC on look4 (the deterministic pre-fix collapse: duplicate track
from coast drift): no duplicate tid for cid 200 + first_use>commit. Outcome
validation of warm/reactive needs the 20-run campaign, not the smoke.

SMOKE PASSED + TAG khonsu-eval-freeze-1h (2026-09-06): commit 71c9f37e (branch
idfix-assoc), local annotated tag not pushed. Six cells all real runs:
look4 CLEAN (idfix fixed the collapse: single tid=1 for cid 200, first_use>commit,
PUBGATE=28), warm_look1 collided (within 1g 9/10 variance), reactive clean,
accel_warm clean (regenerated runner: HANDOFFROW+AGEROW+COASTROW, wbfu=YES),
burst_warm CLEAN with 6/6 platoon handoffs wbfu=YES -> FORWARDING NOT NEEDED
(held question resolved: at-commit delivery suffices), burst_cold collided/0
handoffs (negative control). All three runners 0-diff vs flow (strong currency).
1h campaign LAUNCHED 2026-09-06 16:00 (peer signed off, GO). Tag pushed to origin
(khonsu-eval-freeze-1h -> 71c9f37e; origin URL corrected to tlandle/eCAV.git).
Measured cadence 3.4 min/run (Atlas).
Atlas frozen_batch_1h.sh (flock /tmp/frozen1h_atlas.lock, runs in idfix_wt):
A(6 arms warm/reactive/kf/edgewarp/handover_snapshot/cold x20, ~6.8h)->B(look2/3/4,
computed,mtr0.5,oracle x20, ~6.8h)->E(theta 0.3/0.4/0.6/0.7/0.9 x5, ~1.4h). warm
arm = the 1s trigger-table row. Per-block land to frozen1h_rows.csv. hl_warm_r1
clean. faults x fencing + netem tail NOT YET BUILT (15h runway; FAULT_MODE/FENCING
env confirmed in runner; build before E ends).
Cetus: cetus_t12_accel_1h.sh (flock /tmp/cetus_1h.lock, checkout-guarded on
71c9f37e) accel T12 N{4,8,12,16,20,24,31}x5 -> t12_lut_1h_accel; then
cetus_1h_tail.sh QUEUED on the same flock (blocking) so it runs unattended:
N=28 x5 flow (bo tau band) -> 5.3 matrix (accel+flow_visible+accel_visible, both
visible runners 0-diff current, 6 arms x10 -> frozen1h_53) -> Table8 (burst 3x5 +
q5 density 3x3x5 -> frozen1h_t8). T19b (platoon {1,2,4,8,16} x 5 arms x5, spec in
nsdi_push_tasks.md:179) NOT YET BUILT (needs PLATOON_N knob check; ~18h runway).
Cetus tail logs need extraction to CSV when blocks land (tail runs but does not
self-extract). Both chains: one CARLA per GPU, fd 9>&- so CARLA cannot hold the
flock, HEAD-verified before running.

CETUS ENV-BUG INCIDENT (2026-09-06 16:2x): the cetus accel run() used
`( "$@" ONCOMING_SPEED=... cmd )` WITHOUT `env`. Words from "$@" expansion are
NOT parsed as shell assignments, so NS3_LUT_N=16 became the command word ->
"command not found"; every cell failed instantly, the chain churned CARLA
restarts (~55s each) for ~30min producing 35 one-line logs, no run started. The
Atlas script was correct (`env "$@"`), which is why Atlas ran. FIX: `env "$@"` in
both cetus scripts. Verified by one-cell-by-hand (accel N=4 warm): cmd_not_found=0,
RUNROW=1 AGEROW=227 HANDOFFROW=1 COASTROW=16, AGEROW lut_n=4 applied. Two standing
lessons: (1) run ONE cell by hand for every new batch SCRIPT before the chain (the
smoke validated runners, not the script's env passing); a `"$@" VAR=x` construct
silently runs the assignment as a command. (2) An inline `ssh host 'pkill -f
PATTERN ...'` SELF-MATCHES: the ssh session's own remote-command line contains
PATTERN, so pkill -9 kills the session before later commands run (symptom:
"Bash completed with no output"). Put kill/clean/launch logic in a named script
on the remote (e.g. cetus_relaunch.sh) invoked by a short ssh command whose
cmdline does not contain the target patterns; use exact script-name patterns that
do not match the manager. Data note: one accel N=4 warm run collided (episodes=2)
vs smoke accel_warm clean; the accel-warm tau at low N is a watch-item for the
accel Table 5 story, to be resolved by the T12 x5-per-level data.

ACCEL SWEEP HALT + DIAGNOSIS (2026-09-06, peer-flagged): accel T12 warm collided
9/9 (N=4 0/5, N=8 0/4) at p95 age 400-600ms, contradicting flow (8 oncoming, same
geometry) 9/10 and FLOW_N=2 5/5. Sweep PAUSED. Findings:
(1) Scenario config UNCHANGED old(2e5ea710) vs freeze-1h: Scenario_1, num_actors=2,
scenario_1_accel.xml (Tesla oncoming spawn x=210 + carlacola truck x=278). Old
runner's "MultiEdgeRightMerge" docstring is STALE.
(2) ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 NOT set by the accel batch, runner, or YAML (grep=0 all three).
scenario_1.py only maneuvers (cruise 5 -> floor 16) when ONCOMING_ACCEL==1; else
constant ONCOMING_SPEED. So accel ran as a NON-maneuvering 2-actor overtake. The
pre-freeze warm-3/4-vs-kf-0/4 REQUIRES maneuvering (kf snapshot predicts constant
velocity fine), so the OLD batch harness set ONCOMING_ACCEL=1. FIX: set
ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 in every accel batch; it is part of the "occluded, maneuvering"
scenario definition and belongs in the per-arm config row.
(3) idfix CLEARED (not the cause): cid 199 trace in a collided run = single tid=1
(158 tracker lines), ALIVE at contact (act=True tsu=3), coasting 11.91 m/s, MTR
predicting it (x=290-300). No duplicate, no _merge_duplicate drop, not aged out.
(4) edge_preds_received_total=0 is an ACCOUNTING ARTIFACT: block-A FLOW runs show
the same 0 yet are clean (GT injection + edge broadcasts still act). Not the defect.
CONCLUSION: no idfix track-drop; block A's 20-seed rows are TRUSTWORTHY, continues.
The accel 9/9 is scenario_1_accel.xml geometry/timing + missing ONCOMING_ACCEL,
accel-specific. Controls running: regen cold N=4 x2, old-runner(2e5ea710) warm N=4
x2, control3 regen warm+ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 N=4 x2. Cetus accel sweep + tail (has 5.3
accel arms) PAUSED until the accel scenario definition is settled.

ACCEL ROOT CAUSE = FREEZE-LINEAGE FORECAST-DELIVERY REGRESSION (2026-09-06):
Controls (N=4, identical env, NO ONCOMING_ACCEL): regen cold 2/2 COLLIDED (baseline);
old-runner(2e5ea710) warm 2/2 CLEAN (raw_collision=0, dist 92.9/95.2); regen warm
0/5 COLLIDED. Same env, old CLEAN vs regen COLLIDED => regression is in the
code/stack 2e5ea710->freeze-1h, NOT the env. (pre-freeze redo_accel.sh also never
set ONCOMING_ACCEL; accel discriminates on migration TIMING not maneuvering.)
Two peer suspects REFUTED by the content trace (t12_ac_n4_s1):
  - velocity-reset-on-merge: tid=1 coast |v| flat 11.91 across the window incl. commit;
    no dip. obs_spd=3.4 was post-collision (EGO-DBG tick 345), not the commit value.
  - blind-commit (publish gate): migration COMMIT REFRESH npc=199 16:36:51 (tick 86)
    PRECEDES ego overtake commit 16:37:02; ego inside locale_0 owning cid 199.
REAL mechanism: EGO-DBG ttc=1000 hazard_flag=False at EVERY tick commit->contact, and
NO TRAJ_COLL (collision_check output) before commit. The overtake gate never receives
the oncoming trajectory -> no threat -> GO -> collide, though the edge holds the correct
11.91 track. Defect = forecast DELIVERY into the ego collision_check for the single-
oncoming case, introduced in the freeze lineage; migration itself works. Block A (flow)
NOT degraded (warm 9/10 historical; 8 oncoming + GT-injection<=50m keeps the gate fed);
recommend spot-check one block-A warm TRAJ_COLL/ttc. Forwarding WITHDRAWN by peer (not
the cause). NO code changed. Next: confirm flow gate is fed, then bisect the freeze
commit that dropped single-oncoming delivery. control3 result pending.

ACCEL DIAGNOSIS - 4 HYPOTHESES REFUTED, GAP LOCALIZED (2026-09-06):
Controls (N=4, same env): regen cold 2/2 COLLIDED (baseline); regen warm 0/5;
regen warm+ONCOMING_ACCEL=1 0/2 (env is NOT the fix); old-tree(2e5ea710) warm 2/2
CLEAN. control4 (2e5ea710 runner .py on freeze-1h stack) running = runner-vs-stack
localizer. Refuted with data: (a) blind-commit publish gate (migration commit
16:36:51 < ego commit 16:37:02); (b) velocity-reset-on-merge (tid=1 coast |v| flat
11.91); (c) broadcast-requires-native-detection (tid=1 predicted 31x pre-commit);
(d) memo-bank-frozen-at-import (MTR world_past ADVANCES: last pos = COASTROW proj,
x 248.5->255.7 across pre-commit cycles; x=210 was an early pre-lift sample). At
commit the forecast is CORRECT: oncoming x~256-260 y=199.2 advancing 11.91, ego
x=307.7 y=195.2 (~50m, ~2.2s to close) - yet EGO-DBG ttc=1000 hazard_flag=False
do_ov=True. GAP = the EGO collision_check / overtake gate not consuming the correct
available oncoming forecast in the single-oncoming case (flow: TRAJ_COLL fires,
hazard True; accel: no TRAJ_COLL pre-commit). Oncoming is in the adjacent lane
(y199 vs ego y195) until pull-out; suspect the overtake-path projection does not
receive the oncoming forecast when it is the lone actor. BLOCK A STANDS (edge-fed:
warm 9/10 vs cold collides with identical GT injection; §5.1 = gt oracle within
50m, exclude_managed, occlusion_check, model executed for latency). NO code changed;
await control4 to point at runner (regenerated, flow assumption) vs stack.

ACCEL ROOT CAUSE NAMED (2026-09-06): the overtake gate's moving-only filter drops
the occluded migrated oncoming. behavior_agent.py:1140 reads speed=obs.kf_speed_mps;
line 1147 `if speed < 3.0: continue` skips it. obs.kf_speed_mps (track_utils.py:
107-119) is the TRACKER KF estimate (trk[10]/trk[12]), NOT the migrated latent
velocity. The KF estimate ramps from 0 at track birth (kf_speed 0.00@src13 -> 0.71
@25 -> 1.93@28 -> 3.49@31 -> 6.49@42). For the OCCLUDED single oncoming
(occlusion_check=true, no native detection at destination) the KF never converges,
so kf_speed_mps stays <3, the gate reads a "stationary" oncoming, _nearest_oncoming
_ahead (uses generated_predictions = merged edge+local, def l.1092) returns inf,
_need collapses, GO, collision. COASTROW/migrated v is a correct 11.91 the gate does
NOT use. Flow masks it: unoccluded oncoming within 50m get native GT detections, KF
converges, kf_speed>3. Controls: regen cold 2/2 coll, regen warm 0/5, regen
warm+ACCEL 0/2, old-tree warm 2/2 CLEAN, control4 (old runner .py on freeze stack)
INCONCLUSIVE (API drift 437+ errs). Regression is STACK-side (kf_speed sourcing /
the speed<3 filter is a freeze-lineage change), not the regenerated runner. FIX
DIRECTION (peer's call, no code yet): seed obs.kf_speed_mps for imported/coasting
tracks from the migrated latent velocity (available, correct 11.91), or have the
gate use the coast/migrated velocity; stationary-clutter intent preserved. Block A
(flow) unaffected. DEBUG [OT SIGHT] run confirms onc_spd-at-commit (pending). Accel
sweep + cetus tail PAUSED; block A continues.

CORRECTION (2026-09-06, DEBUG evidence): the kf_speed fix is ALREADY present AND
WORKING - do NOT re-implement it. [OT PREDS] cid=199 spd=11.9 (sibling cid=-1
spd=12.2): the gate's obstacle for the occluded oncoming carries the correct
migrated speed 11.9, not 0. wrapper.py:183-189 (commit cb9888f4) sets a coasting
migrated track's output velocity from _migrated_vel_mps -> obs.kf_speed_mps=11.9,
which the gate reads. So kf_speed sourcing is NOT the defect. REAL defect: only 2
[OT SIGHT] sight-distance evals occurred (both inf/dbg=None -> onc_spd floored 2.0
-> _need 36 -> GO), then do_ov LATCHED True for 49 ticks with no re-check. So the
overtake sight distance is checked only at maneuver START and latches; the oncoming
(spd 11.9) is skipped because at those 2 early evals it was likely not yet in
generated_predictions (npreds=2,3) OR its predicted_trajectory was empty
(_nearest_oncoming_ahead line 1121 `if not traj: continue`) OR geometry. Fix target
= the sight-eval TIMING/LATCH (re-evaluate while committed) or the traj/skip
condition, NOT kf_speed. Next: per-pred skip-reason logging in the 2 sight-evals to
pin (a) timing/latch vs (b) empty-traj vs (c) geometry. Block A 28/120 (~5h, NOT
minutes - peer estimate off). NO code changed. Awaiting peer direction on the trace.

ACCEL ROOT CAUSE PINNED (2026-09-06, ONCDBG per-pred trace): the overtake gate's
LATERAL band drops the head-on-aligning oncoming.
  [ONCDBG] cid=199 traj_len=100 ahead=55.0 lateral=-0.6 speed=11.91 adv=-0.16 REJECT=geom
cid 199 passes all filters EXCEPT lateral: abs(lateral)=0.6 < 1.0 lower bound of the
band `1.0<abs(lateral)<9.0` (behavior_agent.py:1133). The 1.0 bound excludes the
ego's own lane/self but also drops a head-on oncoming that has laterally aligned
(the most dangerous case). Timing/latch: 1st [OT SIGHT] (log line 5337) is BEFORE
cid 199 enters generated_predictions (line 6436); 2nd (6438) after but rejected on
lateral; do_ov latched 255 ticks with only 2 sight-evals. So (a) at the pre-commit
eval the oncoming was not yet in the ego's generated_predictions (ego-side delivery
lag after the edge migration-commit at tick 86), ego GO'd; (b) by the 2nd eval the
ego was pulling out, lateral shrank <1.0, filter dropped it; latch never re-caught.
cid=-1 sibling: native fusion detection (no carla_id; GT injection stamps ids) at
(260.8,198.8) ~7.4m from tid1 (253.4); not merged (merge keys on carla_id, -1 has
none; 7.4m at the 8m gate). Secondary. FIX CANDIDATES (peer's call): (1) for
opposing tracks (adv<0) drop/lower the lateral lower bound; (2) re-evaluate the
sight check while latched, abort/hold on an opposing track; (3) ego-side delivery
lag. (1)+(2) robust; re-eval alone insufficient (lateral band still drops it).
Planner change -> must smoke flow warm/cold + burst before freeze-1i. kf_speed fix
already present+working (cid199 spd=11.9 at gate) - NOT re-implemented. cetus
behavior_agent.py restored to freeze-1h (0 ONCDBG, HEAD 71c9f37e); NO campaign code
changed. Block A continues on 1h (pre-fix reference).

FREEZE-1i FIX (2026-09-06, peer-approved, branch fix-oncoming-gate off 71c9f37e,
commit ab5bab5a). Two files:
- behavior_agent.py: (1) _nearest_oncoming_ahead lifts the lateral LOWER bound for
  opposing (adv<0) tracks (|lateral|<9 vs 1<|lateral|<9), so a head-on aligning
  oncoming (measured lateral 0.6m) is no longer dropped; non-opposing/flow geometry
  unchanged. (2) run_step re-evaluates the overtake sight distance EVERY latched
  tick (was 2 evals over a 255-tick latch), holds via the proper-response brake
  (_committed_brake_ttl) when an opposing track is inside the required clearance,
  logs [OT RECHECK] HOLD/CLEAR with subj_ahead (ego-along-heading distance to the
  overtake subject: >0 not-yet-cleared=stall, <0 cleared=safe; per peer's
  stall-vs-escape rule).
- edge_manager: [EVAL] Future-predictions horizons [5,10,25]->[5,10,25,60,100]
  (+3.0s,+5.0s; index clamped for the 100-pt traj) and stamps tick/arm/tag on the
  [EVAL] line so the post-handoff FDE@5s/ADE@3s extractor (T9 + microbench_fde)
  joins on cid+tick. T9-from-1h DROPPED (1h logs cap forecast at +1.25s); T9 +
  microbench_fde land from 1i.
Smoke (cetus, 11 arms: accel warm x3 + cold x2 [ONCOMING_ACCEL=1], flow warm look1
x2 + reactive + cold, burst warm + cold) RUNNING on the gate fix; assert [OT
RECHECK] logged whenever latched, and (peer rule) if accel warm collides WITH HOLD
lines, inspect subj_ahead (stall) before tagging. On pass: tag+push
khonsu-eval-freeze-1i on ab5bab5a, stop block A on 1h, restart Atlas A->B->E->
faults->netem and cetus (accel T12 ONCOMING_ACCEL=1, N=28 flow, 5.3, Table8, T19b)
on 1i. cid=-1 sibling recorded as T10 (unidentified native detections near a
migrated track; leave the 8m gate). CPU queue: T9 -> microbench_fde -> corridor
regen -> T22.

FREEZE-1i SMOKE RESULT (2026-09-06): NOT TAGGED. accel warm still collides with the
fix (fix_accel_warm_r1/r2 episodes=1). Split: DETECTION (fix 1, lateral bound) WORKS
- [OT RECHECK] HOLD=93/277 with clear=40m need=91m onc_spd=15.7, the gate now sees
the head-on oncoming. RESPONSE (fix 2) FAILS - at first HOLD subj_ahead=18.8m (ego
NOT cleared the subject) and the ego does not brake (EGO-DBG brake_ttl=0, spd ~11
m/s through ticks 390-405, do_ov=True): the recheck's self._committed_brake_ttl=20
is overridden by the overtake-continuation path, so the hold produces no brake and
the ego drives through -> collision. Two response fixes needed (detection stays):
(a) subj_ahead>0 => ABORT to the ego's lane (per peer rule), not brake in the
oncoming lane; (b) _committed_brake_ttl is ineffective mid-overtake, so the abort
must set do_overtake=False + trigger return-to-lane, completing the pass only when
subj_ahead<0 (cleared). fix_wt commit ab5bab5a (branch fix-oncoming-gate) is the
DETECTION-correct but RESPONSE-incomplete candidate; do NOT tag until accel warm is
actually clean. Smoke still finishing flow/burst cells (confirm fix 1 does not break
the working arms). Awaiting peer direction on the abort-to-lane response before
re-implementing + re-smoking. Block A still on 1h; nothing tagged; no campaign code
changed.

ABORT-TO-LANE RESPONSE implemented (2026-09-06, peer-approved, freeze-1i candidate
bd8d9133 on fix-oncoming-gate). Detection-only smoke had confirmed the brake-hold
was ineffective (accel warm 0/3, detection worked: HOLD=93/277 onc_spd=15.7, but
brake_ttl=0 spd~11 -> collide; first HOLD subj_ahead=18.8m = not cleared). New
response (behavior_agent): on recheck clear<need -> subj_ahead>=0 ABORT
(do_overtake=False, overtake_counter=0, return-to-lane), subj_ahead<0 COMPLETE;
re-commit blocked until 10 consecutive clear ticks (guard added at the do_overtake
=True commit, and an elif branch counts clear ticks while aborted); [OT RECHECK]
logs ABORT/COMPLETE/CLEAR/RECOMMIT-OK + subj_ahead; __init__ adds _ot_aborted /
_ot_abort_hold_ticks. edge_manager [EVAL] horizons/tag change stays bundled.
Folded flow/burst into the abort re-smoke (all 11 arms; detection-only smoke had
only reached 4/11, no flow/burst run). Abort re-smoke RUNNING on cetus (overlay
verified to carry abort code). Process note: inline ssh pkill self-matched the
session (cmdline contained the script name) - moved kill+relaunch to a named remote
script cetus_fixsmoke_relaunch.sh. TAG CRITERIA (peer): accel warm 3/3 zero contact,
<=1 ABORT-recommit cycle/run, accel cold colliding, flow warm look1/reactive at 1h
pattern, burst warm clean; report the completion field (abort-and-never-pass = clean
-but-did-not-complete, a different result, not a pass). No tag until met.

FREEZE-1i MERGE + POLICY (2026-09-06, Tyler via peer): folded Jordan's
origin/jordan-behavior-fixes (f012239c separate overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead;
4f7b5150 curved-road-suppression removal in step-8; 7adcdd81 late-fusion RSU-loop
restore) into fix-oncoming-gate. Merge a823e541 (zero conflicts) carried both my
gate changes and Jordan's + also dragged Aug-22 data CSVs; per the CODE-ONLY-tag
policy I made a follow-up commit that reverts docs/kb/data + current_state.md and
git-rm's the merge-added CSVs. freeze-1i CODE-ONLY candidate = 8f736384 (verified:
behavior_agent + both edge_managers + khonsu_shape_check, zero docs/kb/data). collision
_time_ahead=2 == Jordan's overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead default 2.0 (record both
in per-arm config). DATA committed separately on develop: 2c327fdd ("data: corrected
T12 collided flags + maneuver-age columns; freeze-policy note") - t12_lut_rows N=31
s1/s4 collided=1, maneuver cols, README provenance (data on develop, code in tags,
eval_tag per row). DRIFT (peer q): 18m was PRE-FIX (coast EMA restarted at 0 on
import); on freeze-1h COASTROW vel=11.91 vs true 12 (err 0.09 m/s), spf=0.199, proj
correct -> residual ~0.2-0.4m, no record/coast bug; confirm on look4 when block B
runs. NEXT: abort-only smoke table -> merged 11-arm smoke on 8f736384's planner ->
tag+push khonsu-eval-freeze-1i on 8f736384 (Jordan hashes in msg) only on pass ->
stop block A -> restart both chains on 1i. Tag HELD until merged smoke passes.

DEADLINE PUSH (2026-09-06 eve, Tyler presents 11:00 tomorrow): tag is critical path.
Block A stopped 47/120, landed frozen1h_rows.csv. ABORT-ONLY smoke: accel warm 0/3
(abort fires + recommit but the ONCOMING_ACCEL slow-cruise-then-floor profile
defeats the gap-based re-commit -> collide); flow warm look1 clean. So abort alone
does NOT fix accel. MERGED code 8f736384 (my gate + Jordan's separate
overtake_lane_safety_time_ahead + curved-road removal) is the real test. Merged
11-arm smoke RUNNING: cetus accel (m_accel_warm x3 + cold x2, ONCOMING_ACCEL=1) +
Atlas flow/burst (idfix_wt overlay, m_flow_warm_look1 x2/reactive/cold, burst
warm/cold), each cell [LAUNCHENV]-stamped + EVAL_TAG=freeze-1i. Gate:
scripts/khonsu_accept.py (committed c9573b0b, 10 invariants, PASS/FAIL per cell,
exit0 on all-PASS) + README one-liner. Gate watcher bpd80mv55 runs it on all 11
cells when both smokes land. DECISION (peer): (a) accel warm passes -> tag 1i +
launch all; (b) accel warm collides but every other invariant + flow/burst pass ->
tag 1i ANYWAY, launch CONSTANT-VELOCITY only tonight (Atlas A1-10->B1-10->E->A11-20
->B11-20->faults->netem; cetus Table8->N28->bo-T12-rerun->flow_visible), DEFER
accel/maneuvering cells to freeze-1j. 1j accel fix direction: re-commit uses the
oncoming FORECAST over pass duration (predicted arrival at pass zone vs ego pass
time) not current gap; read Jordan's lane-safety check first. Atlas 1i batch
prepped (frozen_batch_1i.sh, A1-10-first order, lands frozen1i_rows.csv per block).
NEXT: gate table -> tag 8f736384 as khonsu-eval-freeze-1i (Jordan hashes in msg) ->
launch -> message peer. Data commit 2c327fdd on develop; freeze policy = code-only.
- REVIEWER-PASS + FDE/MICROBENCH/CORRIDOR RESOLUTIONS (2026-09-08, consolidated): FDE METRIC = FDE (Tyler; no ADE/minADE/miss/generic displacement). The diag fde3/fde5 (69/61.8/40.7) was the run-mean TOP-mode displacement error, MISLABELED - kept only for the depth-ordering, relabeled. Table 5 minFDE (0.6-1.6) was PROJECTED/hardcoded in make_mock_data; to be measured via 6-mode [MODESROW] logging (in edge_manager_merged_1l) + the 30-run FDE subset (frozen1l_fde_rows.csv, fde5_m/fde3_m = min of the two planner-consumed modes + fde5_top_m), queued on Atlas after a=0.5 (atlas_1l_fde_subset.sh, gated on _acc05_done). ORDER 2: the frozen top mode is PREDICTOR-QUALITY, NOT a closed-loop driver - the planner reads near-anchor+KF-speed (overtake/recheck), top-2-with-fallback (crossing check), live positions (hazard); frozen rate ~16-22%/arm uncorrelated with completion (frozen1k_topmode_rows.csv, 51fbb5b5). MICROBENCH: harness.py is SYNTHETIC parametric maneuvers (NOT V2X-Seq; the paper's dataset claim was unbacked -> paper describes parametric, V2X-Seq re-land is post-deadline ~1-2d). Table 6 = one-step post-handoff tracking-recovery error vs GT (NOT FDE); Fig 5 history-depth NON-MONOTONIC (2 frames recover near-full one-step accuracy, CV fallback below enable_time_thresh=5; matches closed-loop knee-at-2); Fig 4 = REAL filterpy KF vs SSM, velocity-init seeded from first-two-dets (matches closed-loop kf.x full-state export ab3dmot_state_transfer.py:91/134), window t in [0,2]s: SSM ~2x lower one-step on turn/brake/lane-change, KF near-exact+slightly-better on straight. All in docs/kb/data/relay_eval_2026_08 (one_step_err_m; microbench_onestep/history_depth 12e86638, kf_vs_ssm d311c179; generators gen_ssm_microbench 8932a8eb + gen_kf_vs_ssm 25623cd4; FDE@5s recompute quarantined as diagnostic 8c904cb1). DUPLICATE-PER-LEAD: none at 2/3/4s (extrapolated track stayed in the gate). EdgeWarp t8 -> edgewarp_full (cetus tail v2). CORRIDOR: reduced Town01 (3 locales ~150m over the 500m straight, 2 crossings) BUILT + verified (a193fc0f): next-hop helper replaces both next(!=), per-crossing latch re-arm, ego/ownership/epoch/shadow untouched; files staged to cetus /tmp/corridor_stage; smoke = option-1 (hold tail when T25 rerun lands, deploy, smoke, release; up to 3 attempts at tail block boundaries; report [CORRIDORCROSS] epoch1->epoch2 + fresh shadow) then 60-route block after the tail. GIT: reconciled after an accidental --amend on the shared develop (RULE: never --amend on the shared checkout; explicit-pathspec commits only). Watches: b83l48l9x (Atlas accel done->land frozen1l_acc_rows.csv), bs3840z0x (cetus T25 rerun done->land frozen1k_t25_rows.csv + corridor smoke). Pending Tyler: freshness AOI (moved last, gated), real-fusion probe (last cetus item, 1-cell gate). To build: non-central runner (#36).
