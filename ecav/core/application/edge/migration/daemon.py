"""SequentialMigrationDaemon: single-process vehicle hand-off coordinator.

Wires the mechanism path (instant store-pull + ownership move) with the
measurement path (InterLocaleLink.model_transfer records a TransferCost)
without conflating the two.

Phase 1 (this module) — sequential single-process:
  The state store is a dict in sim_api.ScenarioManager.
  The ownership move is a pair of in-process member-function calls.

Phase 2 (-eo) upgrade path:
  Swap store  → registration-server do-tick state array.
  Swap ownership ping → peer RPC.

Phase 3 (C++) upgrade path:
  Swap store → C++ shared buffer.
  TransferCost + InterLocaleLink are unchanged across phases.
