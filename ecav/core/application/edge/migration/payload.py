"""MigrationPayload: the unit migrated between locales.

A payload carries the per-track state that lets the destination locale
resume inference without warm-up. Two tracker backends are supported:

* MambaTrack: the input history the learned motion model conditions on
  (``memo_bank`` and ``diff_memo_bank``) plus the tracker bookkeeping needed
  to keep the track identified and associated. The factory functions that
  build this from a live MambaTracklet3D live in :mod:`.factories` to keep
  this module free of torch imports.
* AB3DMOT: an explicit Kalman snapshot (:class:`KFState`) extracted from the
  source edge's filter, injected as a warm KF at the destination.

In both cases the model (weights, architecture) is shared across locales;
only the per-track state changes per vehicle and per tick and is serialized
into a payload. The serialized size here is a model for the simulated
inter-locale link; a real-world deployment would carry the same per-track
state over a real network protocol rather than pickle.
