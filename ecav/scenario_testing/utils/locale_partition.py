"""Q7 deployability study: partition a CARLA town into conflict-anchored
locales and measure the boundary geometry the migration protocol must serve.

Rule: locales anchor on junction centers (conflict zones); a boundary sits at
the midpoint of each inter-junction road, i.e. at maximal distance from both
adjacent conflicts. The boundary-to-conflict separation of that boundary is
half the inter-junction road length. Each protocol needs separation
>= D* = v x T_recover to re-establish state before the conflict; the fraction
of a map's boundaries meeting that is its deployable share.

Usage:
  python locale_partition.py --towns Town01 Town03 --out <dir> [--host localhost]
