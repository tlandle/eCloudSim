"""Corridor (three-locale) landers for the reduced-corridor evaluation.

Post-hoc log lander for the corridor campaign (openscenario_1_corridor_gt).
Parses .log files only; no simulator, GPU, or sim-code changes. STD columns
reuse khonsu_design_extract's [RUNROW] parser (parse_log); per-crossing rows
come from the corridor runner's [CORRIDORCROSS] lines.

Two CSVs (both re-parse the whole logdir on each run, overwrite):

  frozen1l_corridor_crossings.csv (schema row 55) -- one row per crossing:
    tag, arm, seed, npc, crossing_index, src_locale, dst_locale,
    prepare_tick, crossing_tick, first_dst_track_tick, first_use_tick,
    warm, age_at_use_ms, compliant, bytes, eval_tag, machine

  frozen1l_corridor_rows.csv (schema row 53) -- one row per route (run):
    STD (mode/trigger/eps/ct/tx/by/dist_m/time_s/completed/collided) +
    route_success, n_crossings, warm_frac, compliance_frac,
    bytes_per_crossing, tau_ms, complete_m, eval_tag, machine

Definitions:
  route_success   completed the corridor (ego dist_m >= --complete-m) AND no
                  collision (RUNROW collided == no).
  warm_frac       fraction of the route's crossings with warm == YES
                  (dst held the imported track before first use / crossing).
  age_at_use_ms   (first_use_tick - production_tick) * DT_MS, floored at 0.
                  production_tick = crossing_tick for the final-sync arms
                  (warm / edgewarp / edgewarp_full / repl_final / kf_final)
                  when the crossing tick is known, else prepare_tick. This is
                  the age-at-use of the migrated state (AoI at the planner).
  compliant       age_at_use_ms < --tau-ms and the crossing was actually used
                  (first_use_tick >= 0).
  compliance_frac fraction of the route's crossings that are compliant.

Usage:
  python scripts/khonsu_corridor_land.py <logdir> [--outdir DIR]
         [--tau-ms 500] [--complete-m 350] [--dt-ms 50] [--tag TAG]
